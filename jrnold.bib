  Abstract                 = { Event data are one of the most widely used indicators in quantitative international relations research. To date, most of the models using event data have constructed numerical indicators based on the characteristics of the events measured in isolation and then aggregated. An alternative approach is to use quantitative pattern recognition techniques to compare an existing sequence of behaviors to a set of similar historical cases. This has much in common with human reasoning by historical analogy while providing the advantages of systematic and replicable analysis possible using machine-coded event data and statistical models. This chapter uses "hidden Markov models" --- a recently developed sequence-comparison technique widely used in computational speech recognition --- to measure similarities among international crises. The models are first estimated using the Behavioral Correlates of War data set of historical crises, then applied to an event data set covering political behavior in the contemporary Middle East for the period April 1979 through February 1997. A split-sample test of the hidden Markov models perfectly differentiates crises involving war from those not involving war in the cases used to estimate the models. The models also provide a high level of discrimination in a set of test cases not used in the estimated, and most of the erroneously-classified cases have plausible distinguishing features. The difference between the war and nonwar models also correlates significantly with a scaled measure of conflict in the contemporary Middle East. This suggests that hidden Markov models could be used to develop conflict measures based on event similarities to historical conflicts rather than on aggregated event scores. },

  Abstract                 = {Why do governments employ inefficient policies to redistribute income towards special interest groups (SIGs) when more efficient ones are available? To address this puzzle we derive and test predictions for a set of policies where detailed data is available and an efficiency ranking is feasible: tariffs vs. non-tariff barriers (NTBs). In our policy choice model a government bargaining with domestic SIGs can gain by constraining tariffs through international agreements even if this leads to the use of the less efficient NTBs. This generates two key testable predictions (i) there is imperfect policy substitution, i.e. tighter tariff constraints are not fully offset by the higher NTBs they generate and (ii) the decision to commit to constraints depends on the government's bargaining power relative to SIGs. Using detailed data, we confirm that tariff constraints in trade agreements increase the likelihood and restrictiveness of NTBs. We also provide a structural estimate that indicates NTBs are less efficient than the tariffs they imperfectly replace. Moreover, we find parametric and non-parametric evidence that the higher the government bargaining power relative to a SIG the more relaxed the tariff constraint it chooses. This result is stronger for organized industries, which further supports the theory. The main theoretical insights and empirical approach can be applied to other policies to provide additional evidence on inefficient redistribution.},

  Abstract                 = {Most quantitative assessments of civil conflict draw on annual country-level data to determine a baseline hazard of conflict onset. The first problem with such analyses is that they ignore factors associated with the precipitation of violence, such as elections and natural disasters and other trigger mechanisms. Given that baseline hazards are relatively static, most of the temporal variation in risk is associated with such precipitating factors. The second problem with most quantitative analyses of conflict is that they assume that civil conflicts are distributed uniformly throughout the country. This is rarely the case; most intrastate armed conflicts take place in the periphery of the country, well away from the capital and often along international borders. Analysts fail to disaggregate temporally as well as spatially. While other contributions to this issue focus on the temporal aspect of conflict, this article addresses the second issue: the spatial resolution of analysis. To adequately assess the baseline risk of armed conflict, this article develops a unified prediction model that combines a quantitative assessment of conflict risk at the country level with country-specific sub-national analyses at first-order administrative regions. Geo-referenced data on aspects of social, economic, and political exclusion, as well as endemic poverty and physical geography, are featured as the principal local indicators of latent conflict. Using Asia as a test case, this article demonstrates the unique contribution of applying a localized approach to conflict prediction that explicitly captures sub-national variation in civil conflict risk.},

  Abstract                 = {This article investigates the economic effects of conflict, using the terrorist conflict in the Basque Country as a case study. We find that, after the outbreak of terrorism in the late 1960's, per capita GDP in the Basque Country declined about 10 percentage points relative to a synthetic control region without terrorism. In addition, we use the 1998-1999 truce as a natural experiment. We find that stocks of firms with a significant part of their business in the Basque Country showed a positive relative performance when truce became credible, and a negative relative performance at the end of the cease-fire.},

  Abstract                 = {Matching estimators for average treatment effects are widely used in evaluation research despite the fact that their large sample properties have not been established in many cases. The absence of formal results in this area may be partly due to the fact that standard asymptotic expansions do not apply to matching estimators with a fixed number of matches because such estimators are highly nonsmooth functionals of the data. In this article we develop new methods for analyzing the large sample properties of matching estimators and establish a number of new results. We focus on matching with replacement with a fixed number of matches. First, we show that matching estimators are not N1/2-consistent in general and describe conditions under which matching estimators do attain N1/2-consistency. Second, we show that even in settings where matching estimators are N1/2-consistent, simple matching estimators with a fixed number of matches do not attain the semiparametric efficiency bound. Third, we provide a consistent estimator for the large sample variance that does not require consistent nonparametric estimation of unknown functions. Software for implementing these methods is available in Matlab, Stata, and R.},

  Abstract                 = {We develop an empirically based conception of international legalization to show how law and politics are intertwined across a wide range of institutional forms and to frame the analytic and empirical articles that follow in this volume. International legalization is a form of institutionalization characterized by three dimensions: obligation, precision, and delegation. Obligation means that states are legally bound by rules or commitments and therefore subject to the general rules and procedures of international law. Precision means that the rules are definite, unambiguously defining the conduct they require, authorize, or proscribe. Delegation grants authority to third parties for the implementation of rules, including their interpretation and application, dispute settlement, and (possibly) further rule making. These dimensions are conceptually independent, and each is a matter of degree and gradation. Their various combinations produce a remarkable variety of international legalization. We illustrate a continuum ranging from "hard" legalization (characteristically associated with domestic legal systems) through various forms of ''soft" legalization to situations where law is largely absent. Most international legalization lies between the extremes, where actors combine and invoke varying degrees of obligation, precision, and delegation to create subtle blends of politics and law.},

  Abstract                 = {We examine why international actors-including states, firms, and activists-seek different types of legalized arrangements to solve political and substantive problems. We show how particular forms of legalization provide superior institutional solutions in different circumstances. We begin by examining the baseline advantages of "hard" legalization (that is, precise, legally binding obligations with appropriate third-party delegation). We emphasize, however, that actors often prefer softer forms of legalization (that is, various combinations of reduced precision, less stringent obligation, and weaker delegation), Soft legalization has a number of significant advantages, including that it is easier to achieve, provides strategies for dealing with uncertainty, infringes less on sovereignty, and facilitates compromise among differentiated actors. Although our approach is largely interest-based, we explicitly incorporate the normative elements that are central in law and in recent international relations theorizing. We also consider the important role of nonstate actors who, along with states, are central participants in contemporary international legalization. We illustrate the advantages of various forms of international legal arrangements with examples drawn from articles in this special issue and elsewhere.},

For the first time in over 50 years, there will be no incumbent president or vice president in the race. Instead, the Republican Party, which has seen its popularity and electoral fortunes plummet since 2004, is pinning its hopes of retaining control of the White House on Arizona Senator John McCain—an individual who has frequently clashed with his own party's leadership. And McCain's Democratic opponent will be Illinois Senator Barack Obama, the first African American ever to receive a major-party presidential nomination. },

  Abstract                 = {We study the formation of a ruling coalition in nondemocratic societies where institutions do not enable political commitments. Each individual is endowed with a level of political power. The ruling coalition consists of a subset of the individuals in the society and decides the distribution of resources. A ruling coalition needs to contain enough powerful members to win against any alternative coalition that may challenge it and it needs to be self-enforcing, in the sense that none of its subcoalitions should be able to secede and become the new ruling coalition. We present both an axiomatic approach that captures these notions and determines a (generically) unique ruling coalition and the analysis of a dynamic game of coalition formation that encompasses these ideas. We establish that the subgame perfect equilibria of the coalition formation game coincide with the set of ruling coalitions resulting from the axiomatic approach. A key insight of our analysis is that a coalition is made self-enforcing by the failure of its winning subcoalitions to be self-enforcing. This is most simply illustrated by the following example: with Ã¢â¬Åmajority rule,Ã¢â¬ï¿½ two-person coalitions are generically not self-enforcing and consequently, three-person coalitions are self-enforcing (unless one player is disproportionately powerful). We also characterize the structure of ruling coalitions. For example, we determine the conditions under which ruling coalitions are robust to small changes in the distribution of power and when they are fragile. We also show that when the distribution of power across individuals is relatively equal and there is majoritarian voting, only certain sizes of coalitions (e.g., with Ã¢â¬Åmajority rule,Ã¢â¬ï¿½coalitions of size 3, 7, 15, 31, etc.) can be the ruling coalition.},

We document this reversal using data on urbanization patterns and population density, which, we argue, proxy for economic prosperity. This reversal weighs against a view that links economic development to geographic factors. Instead, we argue that the reversal reflects changes in the institutions resulting from European colonialism. The European intervention appears to have created an "institutional reversal" among these societies, meaning that Europeans were more likely to introduce institutions encouraging investment in regions that were previously poor. This institutional reversal accounts for the reversal in relative incomes. We provide further support for this view by documenting that the reversal in relative incomes took place during the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries, and resulted from societies with good institutions taking advantage of the opportunity to industrialize.},

  Abstract                 = {This book develops a framework for analyzing the creation and consolidation of democracy. Different social groups prefer different political institutions because of the way they allocate political power and resources. Thus democracy is preferred by the majority of citizens, but opposed by elites. Dictatorship nevertheless is not stable when citizens can threaten social disorder and revolution. In response, when the costs of repression are sufficiently high and promises of concessions are not credible, elites may be forced to create democracy. By democratizing, elites credibly transfer political power to the citizens, ensuring social stability. Democracy consolidates when elites do not have strong incentives to overthrow it. These processes depend on the strength of civil society, the structure of political institutions, the nature of political and economic crises, the level of economic inequality, the structure of the economy, and the form and extent of globalization.},

  Abstract                 = { There are many well-developed theories that explain why governments redistribute income, but very few can explain why this often is done in a socially inefficient form. In the theory we develop, compared to efficient methods, inefficient redistribution makes it more attractive to stay in or enter a group that receives subsidies. When political institutions cannot credibly commit to future policy, and when the political influence of a group depends on its size, inefficient redistribution is a tool to sustain political power. Our model may account for the choice of inefficient redistributive policies in agriculture, trade, and the labor market. It also implies that when factors of production are less specific to a sector, inefficient redistribution may be more prevalent. },

  Abstract                 = {We investigate how nondemocratic regimes use the military and how this can lead to the emergence of military dictatorships. Nondemocratic regimes need the use of force in order to remain in power, but this creates a political moral hazard problem; a strong military may not simply work as an agent of the elite but may turn against them in order to create a regime more in line with their own objectives. The political moral hazard problem increases the cost of using repression in nondemocratic regimes and in particular, necessitates high wages and policy concessions to the military. When these concessions are not suÃÂ¢ cient, the military can take action against a nondemocratic regime in order to create its own dictatorship. A more important consequence of the presence of a strong military is that once transition to democracy takes place, the military poses a coup threat against the nascent democratic regime until it is reformed. The anticipation that the military will be reformed in the future acts as an additional motivation for the military to undertake coups against democratic governments. We show that greater inequality makes the use of the military in nondemocratic regimes more likely and also makes it more diÃÂ¢ cult for democracies to prevent military coups. In addition, greater inequality also makes it more likely that nondemocratic regimes are unable to solve the political moral hazard problem and thus creates another channel for the emergence of military dictatorships. Finally, we show that greater natural resource rents make military coups against democracies more likely, but have ambiguous eÃÂ¤ects on the political equilibrium in nondemocracies. This is because with abundant natural resources, repression becomes more valuable to the elite, but also more expensive to maintain because of the more severe political moral hazard problem that natural resources induce.},

As corruption often undermines the purpose of the intervention, governments will try to prevent it. They may create rents for bureaucrats, induce a misallocation of resources, and increase the size of the bureaucracy. Since preventing all corruption is excessively costly, second-best intervention may involve a certain fraction of bureaucrats accepting bribes. When corruption is harder to prevent, there may be both more bureaucrats and higher public-sector wages. Also, the optimal degree of government intervention may be nonmonotonic in the level of income.},

They are relatively easy to use even for estimating very complicated economic models. One simply needs to generate simulated data according to the model and choose parameters that make moments of this simulated data as close as possible to moments of the true data. This paper uses importance sampling techniques to address a significant computational caveat regarding these MSM estimators â that often oneâs economic model is hard to solve. Examples include complicated equilibrium models, auction models, and dynamic programming problems. We show that im- portance sampling can reduce the number of times a particular model needs to be solved in an estimation procedure, significantly decreasing computational burden.},

  Abstract                 = {Plasmodium of Physarum polycephalum is a single cell visible by unaided eye. During its foraging behaviour the cell spans spatially distributed sources of nutrients with a protoplasmic network. Geometrical structure of the protoplasmic networks allows the plasmodium to optimize transfer of nutrients between remote parts of its body, to distributively sense its environment, and make a decentralized decision about further routes of migration. We consider the ten most populated urban areas in United Kingdom and study what would be an optimal layout of transport links between these urban areas from the "plasmodium's point of view". We represent geographical locations of urban areas by oat flakes, inoculate the plasmodium in Greater London area and analyse the plasmodium's foraging behaviour. We simulate the behaviour of the plasmodium using a particle collective which responds to the environmental conditions to construct and minimise transport networks. Results of our scoping experiments show that during its colonization of the experimental space the plasmodium forms a protoplasmic network isomorphic to a network of major motorways except the motorway linking England with Scotland. We also imitate the reaction of transport network to disastrous events and show how the transport network can be reconfigured during natural or artificial cataclysms. The results of the present research lay a basis for future science of bio-inspired urban and road planning.},

To add to the confusion, the laws alternately refer to ranked and unranked distributions.

  Abstract                 = {Lanchester's models of attrition during warfare have served as the basis for several predictions about conflicts between groups of animals. These models and their extensions describe rates of mortality during battles as functions of the number and fighting abilities of individuals in each group, allowing analysis of the determinants of group strength and of the cumulative numbers of casualties. We propose modifications to Lanchester's models to improve their applicability to social animals. In particular, we suggest that the per-capita mortality rate of a group is a decreasing function of the fighting abilities of its members, that the mortality rate is an increasing function of the number of individuals in both groups, and that there will often be diminishing returns for increasing numerical advantage. Models incorporating these assumptions predict that the ability of social animals to win fights depends less on group size and more on individual prowess than under Lanchester's original models. We discuss how data on casualties can be used to distinguish among alternative attrition models.},

Thus, author reputation is computed solely on the basis of content evolution; user-to-user comments or ratings are not used. The author reputation we compute could be used to flag new contributions from low-reputation authors, or it could be used to allow only authors with high reputation to contribute to controversial or critical pages. A reputation system for the Wikipedia could also provide an incentive for high-quality contributions. We have implemented the proposed system, and we have used it to analyze the entire Italian and French Wikipedias, consisting of a total of 691,551 pages and 5,587,523 revisions. Our results show that our notion of reputation has good predictive value: changes performed by low-reputation authors have a significantly larger than average probability of having poor quality, as judged by human observers, and of being later undone, as measured by our algorithms.},

Measuring the contributions of individual authors can be used to divide revenue, to recognize merit, to award status promotions, and to choose the order of authors when citing the content. In the context of the Wikipedia, previous works on author contribution estimation have focused on two criteria: the total text created, and the total number of edits performed. We show that neither of these criteria work well: both techniques are vulnerable to manipulation, and the total-text criterion fails to reward people who polish or re-arrange the content. We consider and compare various alternative criteria that take into account the quality of a contribution, in addition to the quantity, and we analyze how the criteria differ in the way they rank authors according to their contributions. As an outcome of this study, we propose to adopt total edit longevity as a measure of author contribution. Edit longevity is resistant to simple attacks, since edits are counted towards an author's contribution only if other authors accept the contribution. Edit longevity equally rewards people who create content, and people who rearrange or polish the content. Finally, edit longevity distinguishes the people who contribute little (who have contribution close to zero) from spammers or vandals, whose contribution quickly grows negative},

  Abstract                 = {The Wikipedia is a collaborative encyclopedia: anyone can contribute to its articles simply by clicking on an edit button. The open nature of the Wikipedia has been key to its success, but has also created a challenge: how can readers develop an informed opinion on its reliability? We propose a system that computes quantitative values of trust for the text in Wikipedia articles; these trust values provide an indication of text reliability. The system uses as input the revision history of each article, as well as information about the reputation of the contributing authors, as provided by a reputation system. The trust of a word in an article is computed on the basis of the reputation of the original author of the word, as well as the reputation of all authors who edited the text within proximity of the word. The algorithm computes word trust values that vary smoothly across the text; the trust values can be visualized using varying text-background colors. The algorithm ensures that all changes to an article text are reflected in the trust values, preventing surreptitious content changes. We have implemented the proposed system, and we have used it to compute and display the trust of the text of thousands of articles of the English Wikipedia. To validate our trust-computation algorithms, we show that text labeled as low-trust has a significantly higher probability of being edited in the future than text labeled as high-trust.},

  Abstract                 = {The paper discusses the experience to date with the implementation and application of the General Agreement on Trade in Services (GATS), some ten years after its entry into force. One striking observation is the smooth functioning of the Agreement, which has created far less tensions and frictions, including at Ministerial Meetings, than its difficult negotiating history might have suggested. This is due in large part to a high degree of flexibility at several levels: Members have more scope than under the GATT to depart from common horizontal obligations, in particular the MFN principle; they are able to adjust the breadth and depth of their trade commitments (market access and national treatment) to particular sector conditions; and they face less constraints, if any, in the use of trade-related policies such as subsidies, export restrictions, or domestic regulatory interventions. An additional source of flexibility is the uncertainty still surrounding a few core concepts of the Agreement and their sometimes daring application in individual schedules. While the ongoing negotiations also provide an opportunity for technical corrections of scheduling problems, the basic (built-in) flexibility elements of the Agreement Ã¢â¬â including the bottom-up approach of undertaking sector commitments and the possibility of inscribing limitations under individual modes Ã¢â¬â will, of course, persist. (Their actual relevance may, nevertheless, differ significantly between 'old' Members and countries negotiating their accession to the WTO.) Given the broad reach of of the Agreement in terms of membership, sector application, and modal coverage, flexibility may be considered a conditio sine qua non. There is little reason to believe that a more rigid structure would have been acceptable to Uruguay Round participants and, even if so, that it would have proven stable and resilient over time. However, flexibility may come at a cost: lack of meaningful obligations across a reasonably broad range of service sectors. Vested interests may find it far easier than under the GATT to defend their privileges and defy more rational and harmonized trading conditions. While the paper discusses formula-based approaches that have been proposed to improve the quantity and/or quality of sector commitments within the existing framework of GATS, there should be no illusion about the scope for technical solutions to what constitutes a political and institutional challenge.},

  Abstract                 = {Far less attention is given to the even more rapid proliferation of bilateral investment treaties (BITs) and their overlap with obligations assumed by WTO Members under the General Agreement on Trade in Services (GATS). About 60 per cent of world foreign investment stocks are in services and, thus, covered by mode 3 (commercial presence) of the GATS. A closer look reveals that BITs generally apply across a far wider range of sectors, in particular in the case of LDCs and developing countries, than those scheduled under the GATS. Furthermore, a number of obligations enshrined in BITs go beyond their potential counterparts under the GATS. At the same time, since most WTO Members have not listed relevant exemptions from the Most-Favoured-Nation (MFN) clause of the Agreement, their BIT obligations are to be applied on an MFN basis. While this extension may not cause problems in many cases, given generally liberal investment regimes and the focus of most treaties on protecting rather than liberalizing access, inconsistencies remain between the two frameworks. Based on an assessment of relevant provisions, this article discusses options on how WTO Members could proceed.},

  Abstract                 = {Over the past months, it has become increasingly clear that the services negotiations under the Doha Development Agenda will not produce significant improvements on current commitments unless major new impetus is provided. In an introductory section, this paper discusses various impediments, from the perspective of participating governments, that may explain the lack of negotiating momentum to date. It then provides an overview of existing commitments under the GATS (by sector, mode of supply, and level of development) and of the initial offers that had been tabled by early 2005. Despite the substantial benefits that may be associated with the liberalization of services trade, the GATS has obviously not yet lived up to ambitious expectations. For example, on average across all WTO Members, only one-third of all services sectors have been included in current schedules of commitments; and many entries have been combined with significant limitations on market access and national treatment or with the complete exclusion of particular types of transactions (modes of supply) from coverage. While the ongoing services negotiations provide an opportunity to complement the rule-making efforts of the Uruguay Round with genuine market opening, many governments apparently have found it difficult, despite generally more restrictive access regimes and, thus, potentially higher gains from liberalization than in merchandise trade, to undertake or envisage economically significant bindings across a broad range of services. Five years after the inception of the services round, current negotiating arrangements, based mainly on (bilateral) exchanges of requests and offers, may need to be complemented by common points of reference to provide greater focus and guidance.},

  Abstract                 = {Politics remains prominently absent in the literature showing that higher levels of trade integration lead to a larger public sector. As openness increases, the state, acting as a social planner, adopts a salient role to minimize the risks of economic integration and secure social peace. Given the highly redistributive nature of both trade and fiscal policies, we claim, however, that the interaction of the international economy and domestic politics leads to three distinct political-economic equilibria. First, nations may embrace protectionist policies to shore up the welfare of key domestic sectors-without engaging, therefore, in substantial public spending. Second, to maintain trade openness in democracies, policymakers develop compensation policies to muster the support of the losers of openness. Finally, given the tax burden of public compensation, pro-free trade sectors may impose an authoritarian regime to exclude (instead of buying off) their opponents. After formally stating the conditions under which each regime emerges, we test the model on a panel data of around sixty-five developing and developed nations in the period 1950-1990 and explore its implications through a set of key historical cases drawn from the last two centuries.},

Real authority is determined by the structure of information, which in turn depends on the allocation of formal authority. An increase in an agent's real authority promotes initiative but results in a loss of control for the principal. After spelling out (some of) the main determinants of the delegation of formal authority within organizations, the paper examines a number of factors that increase the subordinates' real authority in a formally integrated structure: overload, lenient rules, urgency of decision, reputation, performance measurement, and multiplicity of superiors. Finally, the amount of communication in an organization is shown to depend on the allocation of formal authority.},

In this paper we show that the spectral density of hierarchical networks follow a very different pattern, which can be used as a fingerprint of modularity. Of particular importance is the value $\rho(0)$, related to the homeostatic response of the network: it is maximum for random and scale free networks but very small for hierarchical modular networks. It is also large for an actual biological protein-protein interaction network, demonstrating that the current leading model for such networks is not adequate.},

The models are direct generalizations of univariate stochastic volatility models and represent specific varieties of models recently discussed in the growing multivariate stochastic volatility literature. We discuss model fitting based on retrospective data and sequential analysis for forward filtering and short-term forecasting. Analyses are compared with results from the much simpler method of dynamic variance-matrix discounting that, for over a decade, has been a standard approach in applied financial econometrics. We study these models in analysis, forecasting, and sequential portfolio allocation for a selected set of international exchange-rate-return time series. Our goals are to understand a range of modeling questions arising in using these factor models and to explore empirical performance in portfolio construction relative to discount approaches. We report on our experiences and conclude with comments about the practical utility of structured factor models and on future potential model extensions.},

  Abstract                 = {This paper studies the estimation of dynamic discrete games of incomplete information. Two main econometric issues appear in the estimation of these models: the indeterminacy problem associated with the existence of multiple equilibria and the computational burden in the solution of the game. We propose a class of pseudo maximum likelihood (PML) estimators that deals with these problems, and we study the asymptotic and finite sample properties of several estimators in this class. We first focus on two-step PML estimators, which, although they are attractive for their computational simplicity, have some important limitations: they are seriously biased in small samples; they require consistent nonparametric estimators of players' choice probabilities in the first step, which are not always available; and they are asymptotically inefficient. Second, we show that a recursive extension of the two-step PML, which we call nested pseudo likelihood (NPL), addresses those drawbacks at a relatively small additional computational cost. The NPL estimator is particularly useful in applications where consistent nonparametric estimates of choice probabilities either are not available or are very imprecise, e.g., models with permanent unobserved heterogeneity. Finally, we illustrate these methods in Monte Carlo experiments and in an empirical application to a model of firm entry and exit in oligopoly markets using Chilean data from several retail industries.},

We show that the sequence includes as extreme cases a Hotz2013Miller estimator (for K=1) and Rust's nested fixed point estimator (in the limit when K2192221E). Furthermore, the asymptotic distribution of all the estimators in the sequence is the same and equal to that of the maximum likelihood estimator. We illustrate the performance of our method with several examples based on Rust's bus replacement model.

  Abstract                 = {The present study sought to investigate the meaning of subjectively good sleep, using a longitudinal and intraindividual design. Eight subjects slept in an isolation unit according to an irregular schedule of 6h sleeps and 1h naps, designed to give normal amounts of time in bed (1/3 of total), but variable sleep quality. Eight sleeps and eight naps were used for longitudinal simple and multiple regression analyses with standard polysomnographical sleep variables as predictors and subjective sleep quality as dependent variables. The results showed that subjective sleep quality (and related variables) was closely related to sleep efficiency, but not sleep stages. At least 87\% efficiency was required for ratings of 'rather good' sleep. In addition, sleep quality ratings improved with closeness (of the awakening) to the circadian acrophase (17.00201321.00 hours) of the rectal temperature rhythm. The subjective ease of awakening differed from most other other variables in that it was related to low sleep efficiency. Objective and subjective homologues of sleep length and sleep latency showed high mean intraindividual correlations (r= 0.55 and 0.64, respectively). It was concluded that objective measures of sleep continuity were closely reflected in perceived sleep quality and that sleep quality essentially means sleep continuity.},

  Abstract                 = {A vast literature in statistics, biometrics, and econometrics is concerned with the analysis of binary and polychotomous response data. The classical approach fits a categorical response regression model using maximum likelihood, and inferences about the model are based on the associated asymptotic theory. The accuracy of classical confidence statements is questionable for small sample sizes. In this article, exact Bayesian methods for modeling categorical response data are developed using the idea of data augmentation. The general approach can be summarized as follows. The probit regression model for binary outcomes is seen to have an underlying normal regression structure on latent continuous data. Values of the latent data can be simulated from suitable truncated normal distributions. If the latent data are known, then the posterior distribution of the parameters can be computed using standard results for normal linear models. Draws from this posterior are used to sample new latent data, and the process is iterated with Gibbs sampling. This data augmentation approach provides a general framework for analyzing binary regression models. It leads to the same simplification achieved earlier for censored regression models. Under the proposed framework, the class of probit regression models can be enlarged by using mixtures of normal distributions to model the latent data. In this normal mixture class, one can investigate the sensitivity of the parameter estimates to the choice of "link function," which relates the linear regression estimate to the fitted probabilities. In addition, this approach allows one to easily fit Bayesian hierarchical models. One specific model considered here reflects the belief that the vector of regression coefficients lies on a smaller dimension linear subspace. The methods can also be generalized to multinomial response models with $J > 2$ categories. In the ordered multinomial model, the J categories are ordered and a model is written linking the cumulative response probabilities with the linear regression structure. In the unordered multinomial model, the latent variables have a multivariate normal distribution with unknown variance-covariance matrix. For both multinomial models, the data augmentation method combined with Gibbs sampling is outlined. This approach is especially attractive for the multivariate probit model, where calculating the likelihood can be difficult.},

Here we review the recent advances in the field of complex networks, focusing on the statistical mechanics of network topology and dynamics. After reviewing the empirical data that motivated the recent interest in networks, we discuss the main models and analytical tools, covering random graphs, small-world and scale-free networks, as well as the interplay between topology and the network's robustness against failures and attacks.},

  Abstract                 = {Many complex systems, such as communication networks, display a surprising degree of robustness: while key components regularly malfunction, local failures rarely lead to the loss of the global information-carrying ability of the network. The stability of these complex systems is often attributed to the redundant wiring of the functional web defined by the systems' components. In this paper we demonstrate that error tolerance is not shared by all redundant systems, but it is displayed only by a class of inhomogeneously wired networks, called scale-free networks. We find that scale-free networks, describing a number of systems, such as the World Wide Web, Internet, social networks or a cell, display an unexpected degree of robustness, the ability of their nodes to communicate being unaffected by even unrealistically high failure rates. However, error tolerance comes at a high price: these networks are extremely vulnerable to attacks, i.e. to the selection and removal of a few nodes that play the most important role in assuring the network's connectivity.},

Colonial past and political alliances are major determinants of foreign aid. At the margin, however, countries that democratize receive more aid, ceteris paribus. While foreign aid flows respond to political variables, foreign direct investments are more sensitive to economic incentives, particularly ``good policies'' and protection of property rights in the receiving countries. We also uncover significant differences in the behavior of different donors.},

This book examines how electoral laws, the timing of elections, the ideological orientation of governments, and the nature of competition between political parties influence unemployment, economic growth, inflation, and monetary and fiscal policy. The book presents both a thorough overview of the theoretical literature and a vast amount of empirical evidence. A common belief is that voters reward incumbents who artificially create favorable conditions before an election, even though the economy may take a turn for the worse immediately thereafter. The authors argue that the dynamics of political cycles are far more complex. In their review of the main theoretical approaches to the issues, they demonstrate the multifaceted relationships between macroeconomic and political policies. They also present a broad range of empirical data, from the United States as well as OECD countries. One of their most striking findings is that the United States is not exceptional; the relationships between political and economic cycles are remarkably similar in other democracies, particularly those with two-party systems.},

In addition to providing a more coherent understanding of the findings of these two literatures and some new directions for them, the authors show that many puzzles remain in the field of trade politics--puzzles for which there are no appealing answers or, where there are answers, no strong evidence in support of them. This essay, then, in addition to being a theoretical review of the literature, puts forward an agenda for future study of international trade politics.},

  Abstract                 = {Binary, count, and duration data all code discrete events occurring at points in time. Although a single data generation process can produce all of these three data types, the statistical literature is not very helpful in providing methods to estimate parameters of the same process from each. In fact, only a single theoretical process exists for which known statistical methods can estimate the same parameters--and it is generally used only for count and duration data. The result is that seemingly trivial decisions about which level of data to use can have important consequences for substantive interpretations. We describe the theoretical event process for which results exist, based on time independence. We also derive a set of models for a time-dependent process and compare their predictions to those of a commonly used model. Any hope of understanding and avoiding the more serious problems of aggregation bias in events data is contingent on first deriving a much wider arsenal of statistical models and theoretical processes that are not constrained by the particular forms of data that happen to be available. We discuss these issues and suggest an agenda for political methodologists interested in this very large class of aggregation problems.},

Furthermore, to what extent do states continue to control IOs once authority has been delegated? Examining a variety of different institutions including the World Trade Organization, the United Nations and the European Commission, this book explores the different methods that states employ to ensure their interests are being served, and identifies the problems involved with monitoring and managing IOs. The contributors suggest that it is not inherently more difficult to design effective delegation mechanisms at international level than at domestic level and, drawing on principal-agent theory, help explain the variations that exist in the extent to which states are willing to delegate to IOs. They argue that IOs are neither all evil nor all virtuous, but are better understood as bureaucracies that can be controlled to varying degrees by their political masters.},

  Abstract                 = {Under what conditions do domestic actors use international legal mechanisms to influence domestic policy? Drawing on the European case, where legalization has progressed the furthest, I develop a generalizable framework for explaining variation in the use of the European Union's legal system by domestic actors to influence national policy. Four steps are involved in using the European legal process to pressure for policy change: (1) there must be a point of European law that creates legal standing and promotes the litigant's objectives; (2) litigants must embrace this law, adopting a litigation strategy; (3) a national court must refer the case to the European Court of Justice or apply ECJ jurisprudence; and (4) domestic actors must follow through on the legal victory to pressure national governments. Different factors influence each step, creating cross-national and cross-issue variation in the influence of EU law on national policy. Raising a significant challenge to neofunctionalist theory, I argue that negative interactive effects across the four steps and backlash created by the success of integration can stop or even reverse the expansionary dynamic of the legal process. I conclude by exploring the generalizability of this framework to other international contexts.},

  Abstract                 = {Governments of the Left and Right have distinct partisan economic policies and objectives that they would prefer to pursue. Their propensity to do so, however, is constrained by their desire for reelection. We argue that the ability of governments to further their partisan interests and preside over reelectable macroeconomic outcomes simultaneously is dependent on the organization of the domestic economy, particularly the labor movement. We hypothesize that there are two different paths to desirable macroeconomic performance. In countries with densely and centrally organized labor movements, leftist governments can promote economic growth and reduce inflation and unemployment. Conversely, in countries with weak labor movements, rightist governments can pursue their partisan-preferred macroeconomic strategies and achieve similarly beneficial macroeconomic outcomes. Performance will be poorer in other cases. These hypotheses are supported by analysis of pooled annual time series data for 16 advanced industrial democracies between 1967 and 1984.},

  Abstract                 = {In a time series analysis it is sometimes necessary to assume that the effect of a regressor does not have only immediate impact on the mean response, but that its effects somehow propagate to future times. We adopt, in this work, transfer functions to model such impacts, represented by structural blocks present in dynamic generalized linear models. All the inference is carried under the Bayesian paradigm. Two sources of difficulties emerge for the analytical derivation of posterior distributions: non-Gaussian nature of the response, associated to non-conjugate priors and also non-linearity of the predictor on auto regressive parameters present in transfer functions. The purpose of this work is to produce full Bayesian inference on dynamic generalized linear models with transfer functions, using Markov chain Monte Carlo methods to build samples of the posterior joint distribution of the parameters involved in such models. Several transfer structures are specified, associated to Poisson, Binomial, Gamma and inverse Gaussian responses. Simulated data are analyzed under the resulting models in order to assess their performance. Finally, two applications to real data concerning environmental sciences are made under different model formulations.},

  Abstract                 = {We address the question of the growth of firm size. To this end, we analyze the Compustat data base comprising all publicly-traded United States manufacturing firms within the years 1974-1993. We find that the distribution of firm sizes remains stable for the 20 years we study, i.e., the mean value and standard deviation remain approximately constant. We study the distribution of sizes of the ``new'' companies in each year and find it to be well approximated by a log-normal. We find (i) the distribution of the logarithm of the growth rates, for a fixed growth period of one year, and for companies with approximately the same size $S$ displays an exponential form, and (ii) the fluctuations in the growth rates -- measured by the width of this distribution $\sigma_1$ -- scale as a power law with $S$, $\sigma_1\sim S^{-\beta}$. We find that the exponent $\beta$ takes the same value, within the error bars, for several measures of the size of a company. In particular, we obtain: $\beta=0.20\pm0.03$ for sales, $\beta=0.18\pm0.03$ for number of employees, $\beta=0.18\pm0.03$ for assets, $\beta=0.18\pm0.03$ for cost of goods sold, and $\beta=0.20\pm0.03$ for property, plant, & equipment.},

In this paper a maximum-likelihood method based on the conditional distribution given minimal sufficient statistics for the incidental parameters is suggested. It is proved that conditional maximum-likelihood estimates in the regular case are consistent and asymptotically normally distributed with a simple asymptotic variance. The efficiency problem of this new estimator is discussed in particular with respect to some situations with ancillary information.},

  Abstract                 = {We examine the stability of risk preference within subjects by comparing measures obtained from two elicitation methods, an economics experiment with real monetary rewards and a survey with questions on hypothetical gambles. The survey questions have been validated by numerous empirical studies of investment, insurance demand, smoking and alcohol use, and recent studies have shown the experimental measure is associated with several real-world risky behaviors. For the majority of subjects, we find that risk preferences are not stable across elicitation methods. In interval regression models, subjectsâ risk preference classifications from survey questions on job-based gambles are not associated with risk preference estimates from the experiment. However, we find that risk classifications from inheritance-based gambles are significantly associated with the experimental measure. We identify some subjects for whom risk preference estimates are more strongly correlated across elicitation methods, suggesting that unobserved subject traits like comprehension or effort influence risk preference stability.},

We offer a more explicit and rigorous theory of the offensive/defensive balance based on Hembold conventional war equations (a generalization of Lanchester equations) and Intriligator nuclear war equations. We operationally define the offensive/defensive balance based on weapons characteristics, geography, military organization, perceptions of decision-makers, and, to some extent, tactics. Our offensive/defensive theory illustrates the validity of many of Levy's criticisms of the offensive/defensive concept in historical studies, solves some of the conceptual problems, and provides a stronger theoretical foundation for analysts who will employ the concept in future studies.},

If any one of the three premises does not hold, the liberal linkage between trade and peace is broken. In a recent analysis of seven non-major power dyads, Katherine Barbieri & Jack Levy raise doubts about the second premise upon which the liberal hypothesis rests. In this article, we further test the trade disruption premise. We use an interrupted time-series model to study the impact of war on trade for 14 major power dyads. We find reasonably strong evidence that major power war is associated with a decline in trade relative to pre- and postwar periods. We also investigate the impact of war on trade for 13 non-major power dyads. Here the evidence is weaker but on balance remains supportive of the trade disruption premise.},

Regime-switching models forecast better out-ofsample than single-regime models, including an affine multifactor model, but do not always match moments very well. Regime-switching models incorporating international short-rate and term spread information forecast better, match sample moments better, and classify regimes better than univariate regime-switching models. Finally, the regimes in interest rates correspond reasonably well with business cycles, at least in the United States. },

  Abstract                 = {Research on women in politics suggests that sex discrimination by voters is not entirely a phenomenon of the past. In this paper, we identify a connection between the economics of discrimination and models of political agency. The presence of sex discrimination in the electorate yields the same prediction in both moral hazard and selection models of elections: if voters discount the ability of female candidates, or if voters demand a higher performance threshold for women, then women must be of higher ability, exert greater effort, or both in order to win elections. Thus, on average, the women we observe in office will perform better than the men. We test this central implication of the theory by using legislatorsâ success in delivering federal spending to their home districts as our primary measure of performance. Using both district fixed effects and a regression discontinuity design based on the outcomes from close elections, we find that congresswomen secure roughly 8 to 12 percent more spending from federal discretionary programs than congressmen. This amounts to a premium of about \$44 million per year for districts that send a woman to Capitol Hill. Finally, we find that womenâs superiority in securing particularistic benefits does not hurt their performance in policymaking: women also sponsor more bills and obtain more cosponsorship support for their legislative initiatives than their male colleagues. All of these results are novel.},

  Abstract                 = {In the social sciences, randomized experimentation is the optimal research design for establishing causation. However, for a number of practical reasons, researchers are sometimes unable to conduct experiments and must rely on observational data. In an effort to develop estimators that can approximate experimental results using observational data, scholars have given increasing attention to matching. In this article, we test the performance of matching by gauging the success with which matching approximates experimental results. The voter mobilization experiment presented here comprises a large number of observations (60,000 randomly assigned to the treatment group and nearly two million assigned to the control group) and a rich set of covariates. This study is analyzed in two ways. The first method, instrumental variables estimation, takes advantage of random assignment in order to produce consistent estimates. The second method, matching estimation, ignores random assignment and analyzes the data as though they were nonexperimental. Matching is found to produce biased results in this application because even a rich set of covariates is insufficient to control for preexisting differences between the treatment and control group. Matching, in fact, produces estimates that are no more accurate than those generated by ordinary least squares regression. The experimental findings show that brief paid get-out-the-vote phone calls do not increase turnout, while matching and regression show a large and significant effect.},

  Abstract                 = {This chapter focuses on two of the developments in panel data econometrics since the Handbook chapter by Chamberlain (1984). The first objective of this chapter is to provide a review of linear panel data models with predetermined variables. We discuss the implications of assuming that explanatory variables are predetermined as opposed to strictly exogenous in dynamic structural equations with unobserved heterogeneity. We compare the identification from moment conditions in each case, and the implications of alternative feedback schemes for the time series properties of the errors. We next consider autoregressive error component models under various auxiliary assumptions. There is a trade-off between robustness and efficiency since assumptions of stationary initial conditions or time series homoskedasticity can be very informative, but estimators are not robust to their violation. We also discuss the identification problems that arise in models with predetermined variables and multiple effects. Concerning inference in linear models with predetermined variables, we discuss the form of optimal instruments, and the sampling properties of GMM and LIML-analogue estimators drawing on Monte Carlo results and asymptotic approximations. A number of identification results for limited dependent variable models with fixed effects and strictly exogenous variables are available in the literature, as well as some results on consistent and asymptotically normal estimation of such models. There are also some results available for models of this type including lags of the dependent variable, although even less is known for nonlinear dynamic models. Reviewing the recent work on discrete choice and selectivity models with fixed effects is the second objective of this chapter. A feature of parametric limited dependent variable models is their fragility to auxiliary distributional assumptions. This situation prompted the development of a large literature dealing with semiparametric alternatives (reviewed in Powell, 1994's chapter). The work that we review in the second part of the chapter is thus at the intersection of the panel data literature and that on cross-sectional semiparametric limited dependent variable models.},

  Abstract                 = {We propose a generalized double Pareto prior for Bayesian shrinkage estimation and inferences in linear models. The prior can be obtained via a scale mixture of Laplace or normal distributions, forming a bridge between the Laplace and Normal-Jeffreys' priors. While it has a spike at zero like the Laplace density, it also has a Student's $t$-like tail behavior. Bayesian computation is straightforward via a simple Gibbs sampling algorithm. We investigate the properties of the maximum a posteriori estimator, as sparse estimation plays an important role in many problems, reveal connections with some well-established regularization procedures, and show some asymptotic results. The performance of the prior is tested through simulations and an application.},

  Abstract                 = {The Federal Reserve's Fedwire funds transfer service-the biggest large-value payments system in the United States-has long displayed a peak of activity in the late afternoon. Theory suggests that the concentration of late-afternoon Fedwire activity reflects coordination among participating banks to reduce liquidity costs, delay costs, and credit risk; as these costs and risk change over time, payment timing most likely will be affected. This article seeks to quantify how the changing environment in which Fedwire operates has affected the timing of payment value transferred within the system between 1998 and 2006. It finds that the peak of the timing distribution has become more concentrated, has shifted to later in the day, and has actually divided into two peaks. The authors suggest that these trends can be explained by a rise in the value of payments transferred over Fedwire, the settlement patterns of the private settlement institutions that use the system, and an increase in industry concentration. Although the study's results provide no specific evidence of heightened operational risk attributable to activity occurring later in the day, they point to a high level of interaction between Fedwire and private settlement institutions.},

  Abstract                 = {We study a game in which candidates for elected office first choose platforms and then invest in costly valences (through, for example, campaign spending). The marginal return to valence accumulation depends on the degree of platform polarizationÃ¢â¬âthe closer together are the platforms, the more valence aÃ¯Â¬â¬ects the election outcome. Conse- quently, even though candidates have no policy preferences, they diverge in equilibrium to soften valence competition. Moreover, exogenous increases in incentives for valence accumulation lead to both increased valence and increased polarizationÃ¢â¬âthe latter as a result of candidates seeking to avoid the costs of extra valence. As a result, the increase in valence is smaller in equilibrium than it would have been with exogenous platforms. Finally, the model highlights the overlooked substantive importance of common mod- eling assumptions. In particular, changing the source of uncertainty in our model from noise around the median voter's ideal point to a stochastic shock to one candidate's valence (as is common in the literature) leads to complete platform convergence for all parameter values.},

I account for this puzzle by building a model of court nominations in which senators face political costs for opposing nontraditional nominees. I predict that nontraditional appointments will be more likely when the gridlock interval is large. Testing this prediction using data on appellate court appointments from 1977 to 2004, I find that presidents, particulary Republican presidents, behave as predicted. I then show that accounting for the gridlock interval erases the differences in confirmation duration and rates of success between traditional and nontraditional nominees.},

We focus on first-price sealed-bid and ascending auctions, including extensions to Dutch auctions, Internet auctions, multi-unit auctions, and multi-object auctions. We consider a wide range of underlying structures of bidder demand and information, as well as a variety of types of data one may encounter in applications.

We then relate (ex post) data about volume to (ex ante) bids. We show that bidders have private information about volumes of species and use it as predicted by theory.

In order to evaluate the historical record, we need data for a long run of years. The present paper reviews evidence about covering the period 1945-2001 for nine OECD countries. It is widely believed that rising inequality is attributable to technological change and to globalisation. The second part of the paper argues that these are only part of a complex story. Household incomes depend on public policy and on sources of income apart from work. What is happening at the top of the distribution may need to be explained quite differently.},

While there are other differences between these countries, this paper explores how variations in the political system per se influence equilibrium redistributive tax rates and income distributions. A three-party proportional representation model is developed in which taxes are determined through legislative bargaining among successful electoral parties, and the economic decision for individuals is occupational choice. Political-economic equilibria for this model and for a two-party, winner-take-all, majoritarian system are derived and compared.},

  Abstract                 = {The many motivations for employing agent-based computation in the social sciences are reviewed. It is argued that there exist three distinct uses of agent modeling techniques. One such useÃ¢â¬âthe simplestÃ¢â¬âis conceptually quite close to traditional simulation in operations research. This use arises when equations can be formulated that completely describe a social process, and these equations are explicitly soluble, either analytically or numerically. In the former case, the agent model is merely a tool for presenting results, while in the latter it is a novel kind of Monte Carlo analysis. A second, more commonplace usage of computational agent models arises when mathematical models can be written down but not completely solved. In this case the agent-based model can shed significant light on the solution structure, illustrate dynamical properties of the model, serve to test the dependence of results on parameters and assumptions, and be a source of counter-examples. Finally, there are important classes of problems for which writing down equations is not a useful activity. In such circumstances, resort to agent-based computational models may be the only way available to explore such processes systematically, and constitute a third distinct usage of such models.},

  Year                     = {1999},

  Abstract                 = {A model in which heterogeneous agents form firms is described and empirically tested. Each agent has preferences for both income and leisure and provides a variable input ("effort") to production. There are increasing returns to cooperation, and agents self-organize into productive teams. Within each group the output is divided into equal shares. Each agent periodically adjusts its effort level to maximize its welfare non-cooperatively. Agents are permitted to join other firms or start up new firms when it is welfare maximizing to do so. As a firm becomes large, agents have little incentive to supply effort, since each agent's share is relatively insensitive to its effort level. This gives rise to free riders. As free riding becomes commonplace in a large firm, agents migrate to other firms and the large firm declines. It is demonstrated analytically that there exist Nash equilibrium effort levels within any group, but these are (1) Pareto-dominated by effort configurations that fail to be individually rational, and (2) dynamically unstable for sufficiently large group size. The out-of-equilibrium dynamics are studied by an agent-based computational model. Individual firms grow and perish, there is perpetual adaptation and change at the micro-level, and the composition of each firm at any instant is path-dependent. However, at the aggregate-level stationary firm size, growth rate and lifetime distributions emerge. These are compared to data on U.S. firms. In particular, the power law character of empirical firm size distributions is reproduced by the model. Log growth rates are distributed as a double exponential distribution, while the standard deviation in growth rates scales (decreases) with firm size, both in agreement with recent empirical analyses. Constant returns obtain at the aggregate level, in contrast to the increasing returns of the micro-level. A portrait of this agents-within-firms economy is developed by analyzing typical firm life cycles, typical agent careers, and through cross-sectional analysis. The model parameterization is systematically investigated. Right-skewed size distributions are robust to a variety of alternative specifications of preferences, compensation, interaction structure, and bounded rationality. The role of residual claimants within firms is briefly explored. Finally, it is argued any theory of the firm based on microeconomic equilibrium is unlikely to explain the empirical data on firm sizes, growth rates, and related aggregate regularities.},

  Abstract                 = {This paper uses the political economy model of Battaglini and Coate (2008) to analyze the impact of a balanced budget rule that requires that legislators do not run deÃ¯Â¬ï¿½cits. It considers both a strict rule which cannot be circumvented and a rule that can be overridden by a super-majority of legislators. A strict rule leads to a gradual but substantial reduction in the level of public debt. In the short run, citizens will be worse oÃ¯Â¬â¬ as public spending is reduced and taxes are raised to bring down debt. In the long run, the beneÃ¯Â¬ï¿½ts of a lower debt burden must be weighed against the costs of greater volatility in taxes and less responsive public good provision. To quantify these eÃ¯Â¬â¬ects, the model is calibrated to the U.S. economy. While the long run net beneÃ¯Â¬ï¿½ts are positive, they are outweighed by the short run costs of debt reduction. A rule with a super-majority override has no eÃ¯Â¬â¬ect on citizen welfare or Ã¯Â¬ï¿½scal policy.},

  Abstract                 = {Summary: The fundamental problem of gene selection via cDNA data is to identify which genes are differentially expressed across different kinds of tissue samples (e.g. normal and cancer). cDNA data contain large number of variables (genes) and usually the sample size is relatively small so the selection process can be unstable. Therefore, models which incorporate sparsity in terms of variables (genes) are desirable for this kind of problem. This paper proposes a two-level hierarchical Bayesian model for variable selection which assumes a prior that favors sparseness. We adopt a Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) based computation technique to simulate the parameters from the posteriors. The method is applied to leukemia data from a previous study and a published dataset on breast cancer.Supplementary information: http://stat.tamu.edu/people/faculty/bmallick.html},

This question touches on numerous the- oretical debates about representation and the role of elections, and to answer it we scale observed roll call votes from the 109th and 110th Congresses, presidential support scores, and survey items asked of American voters. This exercise locates Senators, Representatives, the president, and voters in a single policy space, and with this space we show that the median American voter was very well represented by Senate and House chamber medians after the 2006 midterm elections. In contrast, the median Amer- ican voter immediately prior to these elections was not well represented. This suggests that elections are instrumental in fostering what liberal democratic theory would label a fair aggregation of voter pref- erences. We also assess whether median voters across the fifty states are represented in Congress and whether elections within Congressional Districts fairly aggregate preferences, and we show that there are distortions in representation associated with party politics at the state and Congressional District levels.},

  Abstract                 = {What do trade negotiators negotiate about? There are two distinct theoretical approaches in the economics literature that offer an answer to this question: the terms-of-trade theory and the commitment theory. The terms-of-trade theory holds that trade agreements are useful to governments as a means of helping them escape from a terms-of-trade-driven Prisoners' Dilemma. The commitment theory holds that trade agreements are useful to governments as a means of helping them make commitments to the private sector. These theories are not mutually exclusive, but there is little direct evidence on the empirical relevance of either. We attempt to investigate empirically the purpose served by market access commitments negotiated in the World Trade Organization. We find broad support for the terms-of-trade theory in the data. We claim more tentatively to find support in the data for the commitment theory as well.},

We identify backward-stealing and forward-manipulation problems that arise when governments bargain under the MFN principle in a sequential fashion. We show that these problems impede governments from achieving the multilateral efficiency frontier unless further rules of negotiation are imposed. We identify the WTO nullification-or-impairment and renegotiation provisions and its reciprocity norm as rules that are capable of providing solutions to these problems. In this way, we suggest that WTO rules can facilitate the negotiation of efficient multilateral trade agreements in a world in which the addition of new and economically significant countries to the world trading system is an ongoing process.},

This algorithm is based on the principle of dynamic programming and requires at most least-squares operations of order O(T2) for any number of breaks. Our method can be applied to both pure and partial structural change models. Second, we consider the problem of forming confidence intervals for the break dates under various hypotheses about the structure of the data and the errors across segments. Third, we address the issue of testing for structural changes under very general conditions on the data and the errors. Fourth, we address the issue of estimating the number of breaks. Finally, a few empirical applications are presented to illustrate the usefulness of the procedures. All methods discussed are implemented in a GAUSS program.

  Abstract                 = {This paper considers issues related to multiple structural changes, occurring at unknown dates, in the linear regression model estimated by least squares. The main aspects are the properties of the estimators, including the estimates of the break dates, and the construction of tests that allow inference to be made about the presence of structural change and the number of breaks. We consider the general case of a partial structural change model where not all parameters are subject to shifts. We study both fixed and shrinking magnitudes of shifts and obtain the rates of convergence for the estimated break fractions. We also propose a procedure that allows one to test the null hypothesis of, say, l changes, versus the alternative hypothesis of l + 1 changes. This is particularly useful in that it allows a specific to general modeling strategy to consistently determine the appropriate number of changes present. An estimation strategy for which the location of the breaks need not be simultaneously determined is discussed. Instead, our method successively estimates each break point.},

However, the gravity equation is subject to the same econometric critique as earlier cross-industry studies of U.S. tariff and nontariff barriers and U.S. multilateral imports: trade policy is not an exogenous variable. We address econometrically the endogeneity of FTAs. Although instrumental-variable and control-function approaches do not adjust for endogeneity well, a panel approach does. Accounting econometrically for the FTA variable's endogeneity yields striking empirical results: the effect of FTAs on trade flows is quintupled. We find that, on average, an FTA approximately doubles two members' bilateral trade after 10 years. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

  Abstract                 = {In monetary policy, decision makers seek to influence the expectations of agents in ways that can avoid making abrupt, dramatic, and unexpected decisions. Yet in October 1979, Chairman Paul Volcker led the Federal Reserve's Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) unanimously to shift its course in managing U.S. monetary policy, which in turn eventually brought the era of high inflation to an end. Although some analysts argue that "the presence and influence of one individual"--namely, Volcker--is sufficient to explain the policy shift, this overlooks an important feature of monetary policymaking. FOMC chairmen--however, omnipotent they may appear--do not act alone. They require the agreement of other committee members, and in the 1979 revolution, the decision was unanimous. How, then, did Chairman Volcker manage to bring a previously divided committee to a consensus in October 1979, and moreover, how did he retain the support of the committee throughout the following year in the face of mounting political and economic pressure against the Fed? We use automated content analysis to examine the discourse of the FOMC (with this discourse recorded in the verbatim transcripts of meetings). In applying this methodology, we assess the force of the arguments used by Chairman Volcker and find that deliberation in the FOMC did indeed "matter" both in 1979 and 1980. Specifically, Volcker led his colleagues in coming to understand and apply the idea of credible commitment in U.S. monetary policymaking.},

This paper presents a covariate-based random-effects Bayesian approach that allows scholars to estimate ideal points based on fewer votes than required for fixed-effects models. Using covariates brings more information to bear on the estimation; using a Bayesian random-effects approach avoids incidental parameter problems. Among other things, the method allows us to estimate directly the effect of covariates such as party on preferences and to estimate standard errors for ideal points. Monte Carlo results, an empirical application, and a discussion of further applications demonstrate the usefulness of the method.},

  Abstract                 = {Paul Bairoch deflates twenty commonly held myths about economic history. Among these myths are that free trade and population growth have historically led to periods of economic growth, and that colonial powers in the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries became rich through the exploitation of the Third World. Bairoch shows that these beliefs are based on insufficient knowledge and wrong interpretations of the history of economies of the United States, Europe, and the Third World, and he re-examines the facts to set the record straight. Bairoch argues that until the early 1960s, the history of international trade of the developed countries was almost entirely one of protectionism rather than a "Golden Era" of free trade, and he reveals that, in fact, past periods of economic growth in the Western World correlated strongly with protectionist policy. He also demonstrates that developed countries did not exploit the Third World for raw materials during the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, as some economists and many politicians have held. Among the many other myths that Bairoch debunks are beliefs about whether colonization triggered the Industrial Revolution, the effects of the economic development of the West on the Third World, and beliefs about the 1929 crash and the Great Depression. Bairoch's lucid prose makes the book equally accessible to economists of every stripe, as well as to historians, political scientists, and other social scientists.},

  Review                   = {We propose a method for estimating static games of incomplete information. A static game is a generalization of a discrete choice model, such as a multinomial logit or probit, which allows the actions of a group of agents to be interdependent. Unlike most earlier work, the method we propose is semiparametric and does not require the covariates to lie in a discrete set. While the estimator we propose is quite flexible, we demonstrate that in most cases it can be easily implemented using standard statistical packages such as STATA. We also propose an algorithm for simulating the model which finds all equilibria to the game. As an application of our estimator, we study recommendations for high technology stocks between 1998-2003. We find that strategic motives, typically ignored in the empirical literature, appear to be an important consideration in the recommendations submitted by equity analysts.},

It examines the politics that have determined their fate and finds that, despite changes in international law and opinion since the Cold War, impunity still prevails. Western governments are still willing to trump justice with politics; and African presidents still offer solidarity to club members. For recent tyrants, life is only a little more difficult than it was for older ones. Yet their future may be tougher as the globalisation of justice begins to bite. None will be comfortable with the powers granted the International Criminal Court; nor with western disregard of state sovereignty as it targets heads of government still in office who are deemed guilty of international crime. Even the new African Union has abandoned the doctrine of non-interference.},

  Abstract                 = {Recent refinements in social science thinking about power could be used to revitalize this approach to understanding international relations. The relevance of scholarly work on the causal concept of power is explored with regard to the following topics: potential vs. actual power, interdependence, military power, positive sanctions, the zero-sum model of politics, and the distinction between deterrence and compellence. The tendency to exaggerate the fungibility of power resources, the propensity to treat military power resources as the "ultimate" power base, and the emphasis on conflict and negative sanctions at the expense of cooperation and positive sanctions, are still common in international relations scholarship. The most important need is for recognition that the absence of a common denominator of political value in terms of which different scopes of power can be compared is not so much a methodological problem to be solved as it is a real-world constraint to be lived with.},

The two waves are superficial similarities but are fundamentally different. Chief similarities include aggregate trade and capital flow ratios, and the importance of reductions in barriers to international transactions. The fundamental difference lies in the impact that these reductions had on trade in goods versus trade in ideas. Initial conditions constitute another important difference. Before the first wave, all the world was poor and agrarian. When the second wave began, it was sharply divided between rich and poor nations.},

Initializing the outlier/level-shift search with an estimated autoregressive moving average model lowers the power of the level-shift detection statistics. Furthermore, the rule employed by these methods for distinguishing between level shifts and innovation outliers does not work well in the presence of level shifts. A simple modification to Tsay's procedure is proposed that improves the ability to correctly identify level shifts. This modification is relatively easy to implement and appears to be quite effective in practice.},

Using non-parametric methods, we show that the growth rate is an inverted U-shaped function of net changes in inequality: changes in inequality (in any direction) are associated with reduced growth in the next period. The estimated relationship is robust to variations in control variables and estimation methods. This inverted U-curve is consistent with a simple political economy model but it could also reflect the nature of measurement errors, and, in general, efforts to interpret this evidence causally run into difficult identification problems. We show that this non-linearity is sufficient to explain why previous estimates of the relationship between the level of inequality and growth are so different from one another.},

We show that divine equilibria exist by demonstrating that a sequential equilibrium that fails to be divine cannot be in a stable component. However, the stable component of signaling games is typically smaller than the set of divine equilibria. We demonstrate this fact through examples. We also present a characterization of the stable equilibria in generic signaling games.},

  Abstract                 = {The analysis of parliamentary debates is at the confluence of a number of developments in political science. What light can automated and semi-automated techniques throw on such analysis? In this paper we compare two such approaches, one semi-automated (Hamlet) and the other fully automated (Alceste). We use both approaches to identify the prominent themes in debate and to assess how far speakers who favour different positions adopt a distinct pattern of discourse. We seek to assess how far the two approaches yield convergent or divergent analyses. Selecting a second reading debate from the UK House of Commons on a private member bill on abortion in July 1966, we are able to show similarities of analysis despite the detailed differences between the two approaches. In particular the analysis in Hamlet allows identification of the extent to which individual speakers employ one type of vocabulary rather than another Alceste is able to provide a statistical basis for the different classes of vocabulary that occur in the debate.},

  Abstract                 = {The dynamics of many social, technological and economic phenomena are driven by individual human actions, turning the quantitative understanding of human behaviour into a central question of modern science. Current models of human dynamics, used from risk assessment to communications, assume that human actions are randomly distributed in time and thus well approximated by Poisson processes1???3. In contrast, there is increasing evidence that the timing of many human activities, ranging from communication to entertainment and work patterns, follow non-Poisson statistics, characterized by bursts of rapidly occurring events separated by long periods of inactivity4???8. Here I show that the bursty nature of human behaviour is a consequence of a decision-based queuing process9,10: when individuals execute tasks based on some perceived priority, the timing of the tasks will be heavy tailed, with most tasks being rapidly executed, whereas a few experience very long waiting times. In contrast, random or priority blind execution is well approximated by uniform inter-event statistics. These finding have important implications, ranging from resource management to service allocation, in both communications and retail.},

A common property of many large networks is that the vertex connectivities follow a scale-free power-law distribution. This feature was found to be a consequence of two generic mechanisms: (i) networks expand continuously by the addition of new vertices, and (ii) new vertices attach preferentially to sites that are already well connected. A model based on these two ingredients reproduces the observed stationary scale-free distributions, which indicates that the development of large networks is governed by robust self-organizing phenomena that go beyond the particulars of the individual systems.},

Second, they attribute more specificity to commercial liberal theory than actually exists. Third, the authors' empirical findings provide mixed support for liberal theory. While Anderton & Carter advance the debate, there is not enough evidence to support their conclusion that, on balance, war significantly impedes trade and that this fact deters leaders from engaging in war.},

There is particular uncertainty about the need for, and the effectiveness of, treatment in mild cases. To help define the role of nasal continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) treatment in mild OSA we undertook a randomized controlled cross-over trial of CPAP in patients with an apnea- hypopnea index (AHI) of 5 - 30 (mean, 12.9 +/- 6.3 SD). Twenty-four-hour blood pressure and neurobehavioral function were measured at baseline, after 8 wk of treatment with CPAP, and after 8 wk of treatment with an oral placebo tablet. Twenty-eight of 42 patients enrolled in the study completed both treatment arms. Baseline characteristics were not different between those who completed the study and those who did not complete the study. Patients used CPAP for a mean (SD) of 3.53 (2.13) h per night and the mean AHI on the night of CPAP implementation was 4.24 (2.9). Nasal CPAP improved self-reported symptoms of OSA, including snoring, restless sleep, daytime sleepiness, and irritability (in-house questionnaire), more than did placebo, but did not improve objective (Multiple Sleep Latency Test) or subjective (Epworth Sleepiness Scale) measures of daytime sleepiness. We found no benefit of CPAP over placebo in any tests of neurobehavioral function, generic SF-36 (36-item Short Form Medical Outcomes Survey) or sleep-specific (Functional Outcomes of Sleep Questionnaire) quality of life questionnaires, mood score (Profile of Moods States and Beck Depression Index), or 24-h blood pressure. However, the placebo tablet resulted in a significant improvement in a wide range of functional variables compared with baseline. This placebo effect may account for some of the treatment responses to CPAP observed previously in patients with mild OSA.},

Although the social choice literature provides theories about voting equilibria, it does not endogenize the formation of the agenda on which the voting is based and rarely takes into account the institutional structure found in legislatures. In our theory members of the legislature act noncooperatively in choosing strategies to serve their own districts, explicitly taking into account the strategies members adopt in response to the sequential nature of proposal making and voting. The model permits the characterization of a legislative equilibrium reflecting the structure of the legislature and also allows consideration of the choice of elements of that structure in a context in which the standard, institution-free model of social choice theory yields no equilibrium.},

  Abstract                 = {Networked structures arise in a wide array of different contexts such as technological and transportation infrastructures, social phenomena, and biological systems. These highly interconnected systems have recently been the focus of a great deal of attention that has uncovered and characterized their topological complexity. Along with a complex topological structure, real networks display a large heterogeneity in the capacity and intensity of the connections. These features, however, have mainly not been considered in past studies where links are usually represented as binary states, i.e. either present or absent. Here, we study the scientific collaboration network and the world-wide air-transportation network, which are representative examples of social and large infrastructure systems, respectively. In both cases it is possible to assign to each edge of the graph a weight proportional to the intensity or capacity of the connections among the various elements of the network. We define new appropriate metrics combining weighted and topological observables that enable us to characterize the complex statistical properties and heterogeneity of the actual strength of edges and vertices. This information allows us to investigate for the first time the correlations among weighted quantities and the underlying topological structure of the network. These results provide a better description of the hierarchies and organizational principles at the basis of the architecture of weighted networks.},

  Abstract                 = {We study the small-world networks recently introduced by Watts and Strogatz [Nature {\bf 393}, 440 (1998)], using analytical as well as numerical tools. We characterize the geometrical properties resulting from the coexistence of a local structure and random long-range connections, and we examine their evolution with size and disorder strength. We show that any finite value of the disorder is able to trigger a ``small-world'' behaviour as soon as the initial lattice is big enough, and study the crossover between a regular lattice and a ``small-world'' one. These results are corroborated by the investigation of an Ising model defined on the network, showing for every finite disorder fraction a crossover from a high-temperature region dominated by the underlying one-dimensional structure to a mean-field like low-temperature region. In particular there exists a finite-temperature ferromagnetic phase transition as soon as the disorder strength is finite.},

  Abstract                 = {IMF loans react to economic conditions but are also sensitive to political-economy variables. Loans tend to be larger and more frequent when a country has a bigger quota and more professional staff at the IMF and when a country is more connected politically and economically to the United States and major European countries. These results are of considerable interest for their own sake. More importantly for present purposes, the results provide instrumental variables for estimating the effects of IMF loan programs on economic growth and other variables. This instrumental estimation allows us to sort out the economic effects of the loan programs from the responses of IMF lending to economic conditions. The estimates show that a higher IMF loan-participation rate reduces economic growth. IMF lending does not have significant effects on investment, inflation, government consumption, and international openness. However, IMF loan participation has small negative effects on democracy and the rule of law. The reduction in the rule of law implies an additional, indirect channel whereby IMF lending reduces economic growth.},

  Abstract                 = {Why do economies grow? What fixes the long-run rate of growth? These are some of the simplest, but also hardest, questions in economics. Growth of lack of it has huge consequences for a country's citizens. But for various reasons, growth theory has had long fallow patches. Happily, this is changing. In 1956 Robert Solow developed what became the standard neo-classical model of economic growth. Counties grow, on this theory, by accumulating labour and capital. Adding either obeys diminishing returns: the more labour or capital you already have, the more you need for a further given jump in output. One consequence is that an economy with less capital ought to outgrow one with more. Generally, they do. Another is that growth should eventually drop to zero. Awkwardly, it stays positive. To save the theory, long-run growth was explained by an outside factor, technical innovation, which is not in the growth function itselfÃ¢â¬âhence the label "exogenous" for the Solow family of models. Partial as it was, the Solow model won wide acceptance and growth theory slumbered for three decades. Then came two changes. One was an attempt to add technical change and other factors to labour and capital within the growth function so that the model might predict long-run growth without leaning on outside "residuals"Ã¢â¬âthe so-called "endogenous" approach. The other was a huge number of factual studies. Barro and Sala-i-Martin explain all this and more with admirable clarity (and much demanding maths) in the first modern textbook devoted to growth theory. The main theories are examined. The stress throughout is on linking theory to fact. One of three chapters on empirical work suggests how much each of several possible factors would be needed to explain differing international growth rateÃ¢â¬ânot an explanation itself, but an indispensable set of empirical benchmarks.},

  Abstract                 = {In response to criticisms made by Keith Dowding (hereafter KD) of `Capitalists Rule OK', this article argues (1) that there is a genuine structural conflict of interest between consumers and producers, voters and politicians, and capitalists and governments, and (2) that only by ad hoc and arbitrary limitations on the scope of the concept of power can it be denied that consumers collectively have power over producers and capitalists (collectively) have power over government. KD accepts that voters (collectively) have power over governments. Ironically, however, this is by far the most tenuous and generally problematic of the three putative power relations. Furthermore, there is no plausible way of conceding that voters (collectively) have power over politicians without also having to accept the validity of a power relation in the other two cases. The implication is that the thesis that is supposed to justify the standard North American or western European politico-economic system, according to which consumers and voters have power but capitalists do not, is nothing more than ideology, in Marx's sense of a fantastical picture of the world designed by the beneficiaries of the status quo to protect their privileged positions against legitimate demands for revolutionary change. The article concludes by taking up KD's primary objection to `Capitalists Rule', which is its rejection of the proposal to equate power with resources. According to KD's official definition, `resources' are the means of raising and lowering others' utilities. I pointed out in `Capitalists Rule' that KD himself acknowledges the inadequacy of this definition, since he almost immediately goes on to say that people do not necessarily have the power that is attributed to them. Obviously, `power' in this new sense must be something different, and is, in fact, the ability to get people to do what you want them to do or to refrain from doing things you do not want them to do. This is precisely my own proposed definition in `Capitalists Rule'. The only remaining disagreement arises from KD's wish to turn everything that lies between power in his first sense and power in his second (and my) sense into a further `resource'. I argue that this is obfuscatory and, in any case, infeasible.},

  Abstract                 = {A sequence of observations undergoes sudden changes at unknown times. We model the process by supposing that there is an underlying sequence of parameters partitioned into contiguous blocks of equal parameter values; the beginning of each block is said to be a change point. Observations are then assumed to be independent in different blocks given the sequence of parameters. In a Bayesian analysis it is necessary to give probability distributions to both the change points and the parameters. We use product partition models (Barry and Hartigan 1992), which assume that the probability of any partition is proportional to a product of prior cohesions, one for each block in the partition, and that given the blocks the parameters in different blocks have independent prior distributions. Given the observations a new product partition model holds, with posterior cohesions for the blocks and new independent block posterior distributions for parameters. The product model thus provides a convenient machinery for allowing the data to weight the partitions likely to hold; inference about particular parameters may then be made by first conditioning on the partition, and then averaging over all partitions. The parameter values may be estimated exactly in O(n3) calculations, or to an adequate approximation by Markov sampling techniques that are O(n) in the number of observations. The Markov sampling computations are thus practicable for long sequences. We compare this model with a number of alternative approaches to fitting change points and parameters when the error distribution is normal, then show that the proposed method is superior to the alternatives in detecting sharp short-lived changes in the parameters.},

  Abstract                 = {Unequal Democracy debunks many myths about politics in contemporary America, using the widening gap between the rich and the poor to shed disturbing light on the workings of American democracy. Larry Bartels shows that increasing inequality is not simply the result of economic forces, but the product of broad-reaching policy choices in a political system dominated by partisan ideologies and the interests of the wealthy. Bartels demonstrates that elected officials respond to the views of affluent constituents but ignore the views of poor people. He shows that Republican presidents in particular have consistently produced much less income growth for middle-class and working-poor families than for affluent families, greatly increasing inequality. He provides revealing case studies of key policy shifts contributing to inequality, including the massive Bush tax cuts of 2001 and 2003 and the erosion of the minimum wage. Finally, he challenges conventional explanations for why many voters seem to vote against their own economic interests, contending that working-class voters have not been lured into the Republican camp by "values issues" like abortion and gay marriage, as commonly believed, but that Republican presidents have been remarkably successful in timing income growth to cater to short-sighted voters. Unequal Democracy is social science at its very best. It provides a deep and searching analysis of the political causes and consequences of America's growing income gap, and a sobering assessment of the capacity of the American political system to live up to its democratic ideals.},

  Abstract                 = {Census Bureau data reveal large, consistent differences in patterns of real pre-tax income growth under Democratic and Republican presidents in the post-war U.S. Democratic presidents have produced slightly more income growth for poor families than for rich families, resulting in a modest decrease in overall inequality. Republican presidents have produced a great deal more income growth for rich families than for poor families, resulting in a substantial increase in inequality. On average, families at the 95th percentile of the income distribution have experienced identical income growth under Democratic and Republican presidents, while those at the 20th percentile have experienced more than four times as much income growth under Democrats as they have under Republicans. These differences are attributable to partisan differences in unemployment (which has been 30 percent lower under Democratic presidents, on average) and GDP growth (which has been 30 percent higher under Democratic presidents, on average); both unemployment and GDP growth have much stronger effects on income growth at the bottom of the income distribution than at the top. Similar partisan differences appear in the distribution of post-tax income growth of households since 1980, despite corresponding pre-tax income growth data for that period show little evidence of partisan differences.},

This paper specifies the terms of that trade-off by analyzing the asymptotic mean squared errors associated with the instrumental variables estimator when the instrument may not be perfectly exogenous. The analysis shows that even seemingly minor misspecifications can play havoc with statistical inferences based on "quasi-instrumental variable" estimators. Simple rules of thumb are derived by which intuition can be applied to choices among alternative estimators based on different instrumental variables, or between instrumental variable and ordinary least squares estimators. The theoretical analysis is applied to an example drawn from Jacobson's (1990) and Green and Krasno's (1990) work on congressional campaign spending and is bolstered by Monte Carlo simulations that, for the most part, reproduce the patterns of errors predicted by the asymptotic results},

  Abstract                 = {We analyze the betweenness centrality (BC) of nodes in large complex networks. In general, the BC is increasing with connectivity as a power law with an exponent $\eta$. We find that for trees or networks with a small loop density $\eta=2$ while a larger density of loops leads to $\eta<2$. For scale-free networks characterized by an exponent $\gamma$ which describes the connectivity distribution decay, the BC is also distributed according to a power law with a non universal exponent $\delta$. We show that this exponent $\delta$ must satisfy the exact bound $\delta\geq (\gamma+1)/2$. If the scale free network is a tree, then we have the equality $\delta=(\gamma+1)/2$.},

This study reviews international evidence on the hypothesis, finding some support for it. However, the link observed between fiscal and current account deficits is too weak to support the view that deficit reductions in the United States can play a major role in correcting the nation's current account imbalance with the rest of the world.},

But changes in the balance of power can also be stochastic: players can be subject to exogenous stochastic shocks to their capabilities, and also typically devote a portion of their military spending to innovation. We model these phenomena and find that, contrary to previous results for deterministic shifts, rapid or extreme changes in the balance do not necessarily lead to war. Instead, the occurrence of war depends on the playersâ expectations of future trends.},

  Abstract                 = {In canonical accounts of war, conflict outcomes are inherently uncertain. Contesting literatures posit that this uncertainty, arising from stochastic elements of the war-fighting process, may induce conflict due to greater risks of miscalculation or foster peace by breeding caution. We theorize that states, on average, exhibit prudence when confronting greater uncertainty. Despite its conceptual importance, extant proxies for uncertainty at various levels of analysis—such as polarity, balance of power, system concentration, and dyadic relative capabilities—are imprecise and theoretically inappropriate indicators. To overcome this shortcoming, we theorize the conditions that elevate the magnitude of uncertainty over conflict outcomes and introduce a novel measure that captures this uncertainty within any k-state system. Through extensive empirical analysis, we confirm uncertainty’s pacifying effect and show how this effect operates at different levels of analysis.},

  Abstract                 = {This paper proposes and tests a new formal model of the competition for capital using the analogy of a "tournament" as a substitute for the "race-to-the-bottom " model. Our key insight is that political costs that accompany legislating have both direct and indirect effects on the likelihood and scale of reforms. While countries with higher political costs are less likely themselves to enact reforms, the presence of these costs also reduces competing countries' incentives to reform regardless of their own political costs. Domestic politics therefore mitigates the pressures for downward convergence of tax policy despite increased capital mobility. We examine the capital tax policies in OECD countries during the period from 1980 to 1997 and find that states are sensitive to tax reforms in competitor countries, although their responses to reforms are mediated by their own domestic costs to reform. We define two potential sources of political costs of reform: transaction costs, due to the presence of multiple veto players in the legislative process, and constituency costs, due to ideological opposition to policy changes that benefit capital. Our evidence reveals that a reduction in these costs either domestically or abroad increases the likelihood that a country enacts tax reforms.},

Contrary to the unidimensional case, if there is more than one sender, full revelation of information in all states of nature is generically possible, even when the conflict of interest is arbitrarily large. What really matters in transmission of information is the local behavior of senders' indifference curves at the ideal point of the receiver, not the proximity of players' ideal point.},

  Abstract                 = {This article examines the policy consequences of the number of parties in government. We argue that parties externalize costs not borne by their support groups. Larger parties thus internalize more costs than small parties because they represent more groups. This argument implies that the public sector should be larger the more parties there are in the government coalition. We test this prediction using yearly time-series cross-sectional data from 1970 to 1998 in 17 European countries. We find that increasing the number of parties in government increases the fraction of GDP accounted for by government spending by close to half a percentage point, or more than one billion current dollars in the typical year. We find little support for the alternative claim that the number of legislative parties affects the size of the public sector, except via the number of parties in government.},

  Abstract                 = {Trade negotiations deal with possible cuts in bound duties, which differ substantially from applied preferential duties, and even from MFN applied duties. Based on WTOÃÆÃ¢â¬Å¡ÃâÃ¢â¬â¢s Consolidated Tariff Schedules (CTS) database and on national sources, this paper proposes a systematic assessment of ad valorem-equivalent bound duties at the detailed product level, for almost all WTO members. Fully consistent with the assessment of applied protection provided in the MAcMap-HS6 database (BouÃÆÃâÃâÃÂ«t et al., 2004), this work allows the full structure of protection ÃÆÃ¢â¬Å¡ÃâÃ¢â¬âbound, MFN applied, preferential applied duties- to be accurately assessed. We are thus able to provide with the first ever worldwide assessment of the binding overhang, i.e. the gap between bound and applied MFN tariffs. We also assess the likely applied-protection impact of an agreement in the Doha Round, based on the Harbinson Proposal for agricultural products, and on the Girard Proposal for nonagricultural products. In all cases, we show the difference between bound and applied protection to be key in understanding both the structure of protection worldwide, and the possible impact of liberalisation scenario cutting bound duties, as uses to be the case in multilateral liberalisations.},

  Abstract                 = {This article explores the constructivists' institutional socialization hypothesis, positing that intergovernmental organizations (IGOs) make member-state interests more similar over time, thus promoting interest convergence. We first show how this hypothesis can be tested systematically using relatively new data on dyadic interest similarity and joint structured IGO membership, and then we conduct a series of empirical tests. Our results show strong statistical support for the institutional socialization hypothesis, using both global and more restricted regional samples. We also demonstrate how our results are consistent with a longer-term socialization process and cannot be explained by the short-term effect of institutional information. Finally, we show some limits to the institutional socialization hypothesis. Unstructured IGOs reveal no effect in promoting member-state interest convergence. Following recent theory arguing that great powers in the international system often use IGOs for coercive means, we find that institutional socialization gets weaker as the power imbalance within the dyad grows.},

A test of rational expectations in approval shows the hypothesis not to hold. The filter is also used to deal with missing approval data and to study whether interpolation of missing data is an adequate technique. Finally, a dynamic factor analysis of government entrepreneurial activity is performed.Appendices go through the mathematical details of the filter and show how to implement it in the computer language GAUSS.},

  Abstract                 = {Theory: Social scientists almost always use statistical models positing the dependent variable as a linear function of X, despite suspicions that the social and political world is not so parsimonious. Generalized additive models (GAMs) permit each independent variable to be modelled non-parametrically while requiring that the independent variables com- bine additively, striking a sensible balance between the flexibility of non- parametric techniques and the ease of interpretation and familiarity of linear regression. GAMs thus offer social scientists a practical methodology for improving on the extant practice of "linearity by default". Method: We present the statistical concepts and tools underlying GAMs (e.g., scatterplot smoothing, non-parametrics more generally, and accompanying graphical methods), and summarize issues pertaining to estimation, inference, and the statistical properties of GAMs. Monte Carlo experiments assess the validity of tests of linearity accompanying GAMs. Re-analysis of published work in American politics, comparative politics, and international relations demonstrates the usefulness of GAMs in social science settings. Results: Our reanalyses of published work show that GAMs can extract substantive mileage beyond that yielded by linear regression, offering novel insights, particularly in terms of modelling interactions. The Monte Carlo experiments show there is little danger of GAMs spuriously finding non-linear structures.1},

We also provide an alternative estimator of the standard errors that is correct when the error structures show complications found in this type of model. Monte Carlo analysis shows that these "panel-corrected standard errors" perform well. The utility of our approach is demonstrated via a reanalysis of one "social democratic corporatist" model.},

  Abstract                 = {Researchers typically analyze time-series-cross-section data with a binary dependent variable (BTSCS) using ordinary legit or probit. However, BTSCS observations are likely to violate the independence assumption of the ordinary legit or probit statistical model. It is well known that if the observations are temporally related that the results of an ordinary legit or probit analysis may be misleading. In this paper, we provide a simple diagnostic for temporal dependence and a simple remedy. Our remedy is based on the idea that BTSCS data are identical to grouped duration data. This remedy does not require the BTSCS analyst to acquire any further methodological skills, and it can be easily implemented in any standard statistical software package. While our approach is suitable for any type of BTSCS data, we provide examples and applications from the field of International Relations, where BTSCS data are frequently used. We use our methodology to reassess Oneal and Russett's (1997) findings regarding the relationship between economic interdependence, democracy, and peace. Our analyses show that (1) their finding that economic interdependence is associated with peace is an artifact of their failure to account for temporal dependence yet (2) their finding that democracy inhibits conflict is upheld even taking duration dependence into account.},

We note that they also agree with our main methodological point that out-of-sample forecasting performance should be a primary standard used to evaluate international conflict studies. However, we demonstrate that all other methodological conclusions drawn by de Marchi, Gelpi, and Gryanaviski are false. For example, by using the same evaluative criterion for both models, it is easy to see that their claim that properly specified logit models outperform neural network models is incorrect. Finally, we show that flexible neural network models are able to identify important empirical relationships between democracy and conflict that the logit model excludes a priori; this should not be surprising since the logit model is merely a limiting special case of the neural network model. },

Many statistical results change from article to article and specification to specification. Accurate forecasts are nonexistent. In this article we offer a conjecture about one source of this problem: The causes of conflict, theorized to be important but often found to be small or ephemeral, are indeed tiny for the vast majority of dyads, but they are large, stable, and replicable wherever the ex ante probability of conflict is large. This simple idea has an unexpectedly rich array of observable implications, all consistent with the literature. We directly test our conjecture by formulating a statistical model that includes its critical features. Our approach, a version of a "neural network" model, uncovers some interesting structural features of international conflict and, as one evaluative measure, forecasts substantially better than any previous effort. Moreover, this improvement comes at little cost, and it is easy to evaluate whether the model is a statistical improvement over the simpler models commonly used.},

They argue that such models should beestimated with fixed effects when such effects are statisticallynecessary. While we obviously have no disagreement that sometimes fixedeffects are appropriate, we show here that they are pernicious for IRtime-series cross-section models with a binary dependent variable andthat they are often problematic for IR models with a continuousdependent variable. In the binary case, this perniciousness is theresult of many pairs of nations always being scored zero and hencehaving no impact on the parameter estimates; for example, many dyadsnever come into conflict. In the continuous case, fixed effects areproblematic in the presence of the temporally stable regressors that arecommon IR applications, such as the dyadic democracy measures used byGreen, Kim, and Yoon. },

  Abstract                 = { Abstract What makes some states more militarily powerful than others? A growing body of research suggests that certain ânon-materialâ factors significantly affect a country's ability to translate resources into fighting power. In particular, recent studies claim that democracy, Western culture, high levels of human capital, and amicable civil-military relations enhance military effectiveness. If these studies are correct, then military power is not solely or even primarily determined by material resources, and a large chunk of international relations scholarship has been based on a flawed metric. The major finding of this article, however, suggests that this is not the case. In hundreds of battles between 1898 and 1987, the more economically developed side consistently outfought the poorer side on a soldier-for-soldier basis. This is not surprising. What is surprising is that many of the non-material factors posited to affect military capability seem to be irrelevant: when economic development is taken into account, culture and human capital become insignificant and democracy actually seems to degrade warfighting capability. In short, the conventional military dominance of Western democracies stems from superior economic development, not societal pathologies or political institutions. Therefore, a conception of military power that takes into account both the quantity of a state's resources and its level of economic development provides a sound basis for defense planning and international relations scholarship. },

  Abstract                 = {During the past decade, researchers have commonly employed one of two sets of interstate dyads as the population of cases in quantitative analyses of international conflict, choosing to examine either "all dyads" or "politically relevant dyads." The main argument against using the "all dyads" set is that it includes many dyads where there is no chance of conflict, and so analysts using this set are examining many pairs of states in which the hypotheses in question are irrelevant. The criticism of politically relevant dyads is that this set does not capture 15\% to 20\% of the actual conflicts that occur In this paper I examine the current operationalization of "political relevance" to see whether the operationalization can be slightly modified and encompass all actual conflicts. If it could be, then use of the modified politically relevant dyad case subset might be more appropriate or have advantages over what is currently employed. I conclude that while it is possible to improve upon current operationalizations of political relevance (in terms of capturing conflicts), it is difficult to reach a 100\% capture rate. It is also clear from the analysis that the various politically relevant operationalizations do better at capturing wars than militarized interstate disputes (MIDs), and do better at capturing the actions of MID and war originators than MID and war joiners.},

  Abstract                 = {Signorino and Ritter developed and advocated a new measure of the political similarity of states (S). They demonstrated logical flaws associated with the common Kendall's {tau}b-based alliance similarity measure and showed that using S may yield quite different similarity estimates. But without a broader empirical comparison and analysis using S, the full empirical ramifications of this difference is not known. In this study, a comparison of S versus {tau}b is conducted over a wide spatial and temporal domain, examining the relationship between S, {tau}b, expected utility scores, and conflict. Despite significant positive correlations, important differences in the distribution of S and {tau}b-based measures of alliance similarity are found. It should not be assumed that the measures are substitutable. Reanalysis of an important expected utility theory of war shows a stronger relationship between equilibrium predictions and conflict when S is used versus {tau}b.},

Using quantitative data drawn from interstate wars between 1816 and 1990, the authors demonstrate that the wartime advantages that accrue to democratic states are fleeting. In the short run, democracies are more likely to win than are their autocratic opponents. However, although they are at an apparent disadvantage in short wars, autocracies are far less likely to quit as time passes. This willingness to continue fighting ultimately leads to the result that after roughly 18 months have passed, the advantage passes to the autocrat. Democracies at that point become far more likely than autocratic states to quit and more willing to settle for draws or losses. The authors also find that relationships between war outcomes and a number of control variables such as military-industrial capacity and military strategy vary over time.},

We also find that historically, on average, mobilization and strategic surprise have little effect on war duration and that wars are not duration dependent.},

Having briefly described the expert survey, we first explore the substantive policy content of left and right in the expert survey estimates. We then compare the expert survey to the CMP method on methodological grounds. Third, we directly compare the expert survey results to the CMP results for the most recent time period available, revealing some agreement but also numerous inconsistencies in both cross-national and within-country party placements. We conclude by investigating the CMP scores in more detail, focusing on the series of British left-right placements and the components of these scores.},

  Abstract                 = {The Convention on the Future of Europe that led to the eventual drafting of an EU Constitution involved numerous political actors from many countries. Their negotiations over the constitution generated a huge volume of texts containing substantive information about their preferences for EU institutional and political outcomes. In this paper, we attempt to measure these preferences at the national party level by analysing the Convention texts using the computerized `word-scoring' method for text analysis (Laver et al., 2003). For each national party whose delegates' texts were recorded at the Convention, we estimate their positions on four political dimensions. We then test the validity of these estimates by comparing them with measures of national party positions on EU policy dimensions obtained through an extensive expert survey undertaken in 27 countries (the EU 25 plus Turkey and Romania). Our results show strong evidence that the word-scoring method is broadly successful in reconstructing the map of national party preferences for and against a more centralized and more powerful Europe as expressed through the Convention texts.},

A network is a set of vertices and links given by its adjacency matrix $\c$, and the relevant statistical ensembles are defined in terms of a partition function $Z=\sum_{\c} \exp {[}-\beta \H(\c) {]}$. The simplest cases are uncorrelated random networks such as the well-known Erd\"os-R\'eny graphs. Here we study more general interactions $\H(\c)$ which lead to {\em correlations}, for example, between the connectivities of adjacent vertices. In particular, such correlations occur in {\em optimized} networks described by partition functions in the limit $\beta \to \infty$. They are argued to be a crucial signature of evolutionary design in biological networks.},

A generalized Bayes estimator is developed which is significantly better than δ0 if this prior information is correct and yet is very robust with respect to misspecification of the prior information. An associated confidence region is also constructed, and is shown to have very attractive size and probability of coverage.},

  Abstract                 = {Many political scientists and policymakers argue that unmediated eventsÃ¢ÂÂthe successes and failures on the battlefieldÃ¢ÂÂdetermine whether the mass public will support military excursions. The public supports war, the story goes, if the benefits of action outweigh the costs of conflict. Other scholars contend that the balance of elite discourse influences public support for war. I draw upon survey evidence from World War II and the current war in Iraq to come to a common conclusion regarding public support for international interventions. I find little evidence that citizens make complex cost/benefit calculations when evaluating military action. Instead, I find that patterns of elite conflict shape opinion concerning war. When political elites disagree as to the wisdom of intervention, the public divides as well. But when elites come to a common interpretation of a political reality, the public gives them great latitude to wage war.},

  Abstract                 = {Can rational models, once theological explanations are discredited, explain why certain radical religious rebels are so successful in perpetrating suicide attacks? The fundamental barrier to success turns out not to be recruiting suicide attackers; there is a rational basis for volunteering. Rather, the barrier is the danger of other operatives defecting. A club model, portraying voluntary religious organizations as efficient providers of local public goods explains how they weed out potential defectors by requiring sacrifices as signals of commitment. They are thereby able to succeed in risky terrorist attacks. The model has testable implications for tactic choice and damage achieved by clubs and other rebel organizations. Data spanning a half-century on both terrorists and civil war insurgents, much from Middle East sources and Israel/Palestine, reveal that: a) missions organized by radical religious clubs that provide benign local public goods in the absence of competing provision by government are both more lethal and are more likely to be suicide attacks than missions organized by other terrorist groups with similar aims and theologies; and b) suicide attacks are chosen when targets are "hard," i.e., difficult to destroy. Our results suggest benign tactics to counter radical religious terrorism and insurgency.},

  Abstract                 = {This paper argues that developed countries use foreign aid to foster "strategic development" i.e. development abroad that returns material benefits to aid donors. I first develop the idea of strategic development and then show that much of the literature has confused non-altruistic motives with non-development motives: many of the previous findings on aid allocation actually support the idea of strategic development, while at the same time presenting evidence that altruism plays a minor role in aid allocation. I then develop a model that allows donor utility with respect to aid to be increasing in both development and in non-development concessions that the recipient supplies to the donor in exchange for aid. A surprising conclusion follows once we allow donors to pursue multiple strategic objectives with aid dollars. The model developed here suggests that in situations where multiple recipients could serve as substitute providers of a non-development good that is paid for (partially) through aid donations, the donor will choose the recipient that offers the highest returns in terms of development to provide the non-development good. This implies that potential development motives of donors have been dismissed too easily based on the correlation between development aid and non-development dyadic considerations.},

We find that over the June 1989- December 2002 sample period, a typical unanticipated rate cut of 25 basis points is associated with an increase of roughly 1 percent in the level of stock prices, as measured by the CRSP value-weighted index. There is some evidence of a stronger stock price response to changes in rates that are expected to be more permanent or that represent a reversal in the direction of rate changes. The estimated response of stock prices to fund rate surprises varies widely across industries, but in a manner consistent with the predictions of the standard capital asset pricing model. Applying the methods of Campbell (1991) and Campbell and Ammer (1993), we find that most of the effect of monetary policy on stock prices can be traced to its implications for forecasted equity risk premiums. Some effect can be traced to the implications of monetary policy surprises for forecasted dividends, but very little stems from the impact of policy on expectations of the real rate of interest.},

Specifically, we examine five factors that are widely expected to help in reducing beggar-thy-neighbor behavior in the form of transboundary pollution: democracy, supranational institutions, trade relations, stringency of domestic environmental policy, and international environmental commitment. The empirical focus is on upstream-downstream water pollution from point- and non-point sources in Europe in 1970-2003. The observed effects of the five variables differ considerably across forms of pollution and two specifications of beggar-thyneighbor behavior. By and large, our findings suggest that state behavior in this area is strongly path-dependent, and that the forces of democracy, globalization and national and international regulation do not easily produce good neighbors.},

  Abstract                 = {We develop a dynamic, 2-party citizen-candidate model in which candidates are distinguished by both their ideology and their valence. We provide suÃ¯Â¬Æcient conditions under which (i) the median voter is decisive and (ii) there exists a unique symmetric, stage-undominated, stationary perfect Bayesian equilibrium. In our dynamic setting, reputational concerns endogenize incentives to compromise. In equilibrium, we prove that higher valence incumbents compromise more, compro- mise to more extreme policies, and are re-elected more. We find that the correlation between valence and extremism varies across diÃ¯Â¬â¬erent cohorts: the correlation is negative for first-term representatives, but positive in the long-run stationary distribution of oÃ¯Â¬Æce-holders (large congress). This novel result might partially explain the conflicting findings in the empirical literature and theoretical single-election models. We then find that a FOSD improvement in the distribution of valences benefits all voters. More heterogeneity in valence benefits the median voter, but may hurt a majority of voters when voters are suÃ¯Â¬Æciently risk averse. We expand the model to allow interest groups to invest in candidate valence and provide conditions under which the equilibrium expected policy choice of oÃ¯Â¬Æce holders is more extreme when interest groups have more extreme ideologies, reducing welfare of all voters.},

  Abstract                 = {The evolution of digital libraries and the Internet has dramatically transformed the processing, storage, and retrieval of information. Efforts to digitize text, images, video, and audio now consume a substantial portion of both academic and industrial activity. Even when there is no shortage of textual materials on a particular topic, procedures for indexing or extracting the knowledge or conceptual information contained in them can be lacking. Recently developed information retrieval technologies are based on the concept of a vector space. Data are modeled as a matrix, and a user's query of the database is represented as a vector. Relevant documents in the database are then identified via simple vector operations. Orthogonal factorizations of the matrix provide mechanisms for handling uncertainty in the database itself. The purpose of this paper is to show how such fundamental mathematical concepts from linear algebra can be used to manage and index large text collections.},

  Abstract                 = {Currently, most approaches to retrieving textual materials from scientific databases depend on a lexical match between words in users' requests and those in or assigned to documents in a database. Because of the tremendous diversity in the words people use to describe the same document, lexical methods are necessarily incomplete and imprecise. Using the singular value decomposition (SVD), one can take advantage of the implicit higher-order structure in the association of terms with documents by determining the SVD of large sparse term by document matrices. Terms and documents represented by 200-300 of the largest singular vectors are then matched against user queries. We call this retrieval method latent semantic indexing (LSI) because the subspace represents important associative relationships between terms and documents that are not evident in individual documents. LSI is a completely automatic yet intelligent indexing method, widely applicable, and a promising way to improve users' access to many kinds of textual materials, or to documents and services for which textual descriptions are available. A survey of the computational requirements for managing LSI-encoded databases as well as current and future applications of LSI is presented.},

Our primary goal is to present a framework which enables one to obtain estimates of demand and cost parameters for a class of oligopolistic differentiated products markets. These estimates can be obtained using only widely available product-level and aggregate consumer-level data, and they are consistent with a structural model of equilibrium in an oligopolistic industry. When we apply the techniques developed here to the U.S. automobile market, we obtain cost and demand parameters for (essentially) all models marketed over a twenty year period.},

This paper studies incentives in such contexts and emphasizes the role of matching the mission preferences of principals and agents in increasing organizational efficiency. Matching economizes on the need for high-powered incentives. It can also, however, entrench bureaucratic conservatism and resistance to innovations. The framework developed in this paper is applied to school competition, incentives in the public sector and in private nonprofits, and the interdependence of incentives and productivity between the private for-profit sector and the mission-oriented sector through occupational choice.},

  Abstract                 = {We propose a new prior for ultra-sparse signal detection that we term the "horseshoe+ prior." The horseshoe+ prior is a natural extension of the horseshoe prior that has achieved success in the estimation and detection of sparse signals and has been shown to possess a number of desirable theoretical properties while enjoying computational feasibility in high dimensions. The horseshoe+ prior builds upon these advantages. Our work proves that the horseshoe+ posterior concentrates at a rate faster than that of the horseshoe in the Kullback-Leibler (K-L) sense. We also establish theoretically that the proposed estimator has lower posterior mean squared error in estimating signals compared to the horseshoe and achieves the optimal Bayes risk in testing up to a constant. For global-local scale mixture priors, we develop a new technique for analyzing the marginal sparse prior densities using the class of Meijer-G functions. In simulations, the horseshoe+ estimator demonstrates superior performance in a standard design setting against competing methods, including the horseshoe and Dirichlet-Laplace estimators. We conclude with an illustration on a prostate cancer data set and by pointing out some directions for future research.},

I call this the preference monotonicity condition. If preference monotonicity fails, we have two groups of voters such that a change in state induces their rankings to change in opposite ways; and I term this phenomenon as preference reversal. Under preference reversal, for large classes of voting rules we have equilibria with certain outcomes diÃÂ¤erent from the full information outcome. Preference reversal is the generic condition when voter preferences are multidimensional.},

  Abstract                 = {In war, do mass and materiel matter most? Will states with the largest, best equipped, information-technology-rich militaries invariably win? The prevailing answer today among both scholars and policymakers is yes. But this is to overlook force employment, or the doctrine and tactics by which materiel is actually used. In a landmark reconception of battle and war, this book provides a systematic account of how force employment interacts with materiel to produce real combat outcomes. Stephen Biddle argues that force employment is central to modern war, becoming increasingly important since 1900 as the key to surviving ever more lethal weaponry. Technological change produces opposite effects depending on how forces are employed; to focus only on materiel is thus to risk major error--with serious consequences for both policy and scholarship. In clear, fluent prose, Biddle provides a systematic account of force employment's role and shows how this account holds up under rigorous, multimethod testing. The results challenge a wide variety of standard views, from current expectations for a revolution in military affairs to mainstream scholarship in international relations and orthodox interpretations of modern military history. Military Power will have a resounding impact on both scholarship in the field and on policy debates over the future of warfare, the size of the military, and the makeup of the defense budget.},

Yet the concept of the balance itself remains radically underdeveloped theoretically, clouding the predictions of the numerous theories that rest upon it and undermining rigorous empirical work on the many hypotheses these theories imply. I address this problem by presenting and testing a systematic theory of the balance that emphasizes military strategic and tactical choices as its key determinants, by contrast with orthodox offense-defense theory's focus on technology. This new theory outperforms the orthodox view and has broad implications for international relations theory. },

Using panel data for 126 developing countries between 1966 and 2002, and controlling for macroeconomic conditions, economic reforms, and level of democratization, this essay tests the effects of "follow the flag" variables on U.S. FDI. Security factors can affect FDI in two stages: the initial decision over whether to invest and the second stage, which involves the amount invested. Our results indicate a selection effect and that follow the flag factors are influential both in the selection phase and in the main equation for U.S. investors. However, such results are not found for global investors, suggesting that positive links between economic and security goals only hold for U.S. firms.},

  Abstract                 = {This paper attempts to provide a more complete reckoning of the costs of the Iraq War, using standard economic and accounting/ budgetary frameworks. As of December 30, 2005, total spending for combat and support operations in Iraq is \$251bn, and the CBO's estimates put the projected total direct costs at around \$500bn. These figures, however, greatly underestimate the War's true costs. We estimate a range of present and future costs, by including expenditures not in the \$500bn CBO projection, such as lifetime healthcare and disability payments to returning veterans, replenishment of military hardware, and increased recruitment costs. We then make adjustments to reflect the social costs of the resources deployed, (e.g. reserve pay is less than the opportunity wage and disability pay is less than forgone earnings). Finally, we estimate the effects of the war on the overall performance of the economy. Even taking a conservative approach and assuming all US troops return by 2010, we believe the true costs exceed a trillion dollars. Using the CBO's projection of maintaining troops in Iraq through 2015, the true costs may exceed \$2 trillion. In either case, the cost is much larger than the administration's original estimate of \$50-\$60bn. The costs estimated do not include those borne by other countries, either directly (military expenditures) or indirectly (the increased price of oil). Most importantly, we have not included the costs to Iraq, either in terms of destruction of infrastructure or the loss of lives. These would all clearly raise the costs significantly},

Our pooled time series/cross2013sectional panel analysis (n = 18, t = 2) reveals that consensual political institutions are systematically related to lower income inequalities while the reverse is true for majoritarian political institutions. We also make a crucial distinction between 'collective' and 'competitive' veto points. Our multiple regression results provide strong evidence that collective veto points depress income inequalities while competitive veto points tend to widen the inequality of incomes. Thus, some institutional veto points have constraining effects on policy while others have 'enabling' effects.},

  Abstract                 = {An enduring piece of legal wisdom contends that the value of court opinions depreciates as they age and that a variety of factors lead some cases to depreciate faster than others. We test systematically these expectations by examining the rate at which U.S. Supreme Court precedents decided between the 1946 and 2004 Terms depreciate at the U.S. Supreme Court and the U.S. Courts of Appeals. Our results indicate, first, that a precedentâs age has the most pronounced influence on depreciation, and, second, that most factors hypothesized by the literature to influence depreciation have at best minimal to modest effects. There is one notable exception to this latter conclusion, and the âcitation historyâ of a case strongly influences depreciation, but even this relationship substantially decays as cases age. Third, prior studies overestimate the effect of almost every variable used to explain citations because those variables become less influential as cases age.},

  Abstract                 = {Social scientists typically devote considerable effort to mitigating measurement error dur- ing data collection but then ignore the issue during data analysis. Although many statistical methods have been proposed for reducing measurement error-induced biases, few have been widely used because of implausible assumptions, high levels of model dependence, difficult com- putation, or inapplicability with multiple mismeasured variables. We develop an easy-to-use alternative without these problems; it generalizes the popular multiple imputation (mi) frame- work by treating missing data problems as a special case of extreme measurement error and corrects for both. Like mi, the proposed âmultiple overimputationâ (mo) framework is a simple two-step procedure. First, multiple (â 5) completed copies of the data set are created where cells measured without error are held constant, those missing are imputed from the distribution of predicted values, and cells (or entire variables) with measurement error are âoverimputed,â that is imputed from the predictive distribution with observation-level priors defined by the mismeasured values and available external information, if any. In the second step, analysts can then run whatever statistical method they would have run on each of the overimputed data sets as if there had been no missingness or measurement error; the results are then combined via a simple averaging procedure. With this paper, we offer open source software that implements all the methods described herein.},

  Abstract                 = {Most nations have experienced an internal armed conflict since 1960. The past decade has witnessed an explosion of research into the causes and consequences of civil wars, belatedly bringing the topic into the economics mainstream. This article critically reviews this interdisciplinary literature and charts productive paths forward. Formal theory has focused on a central puzzle: why do civil wars occur at all when, given the high costs of war, groups have every incentive to reach an agreement that avoids fighting? Explanations have focused on information asymmetries and the inability to sign binding contracts in the absence of the rule of law. Economic theory has made less progress, however, on the thornier (but equally important) problems of why armed groups form and cohere, and why individuals decide to fight. Likewise, the actual behavior of armed organizations and their leaders is poorly understood. On the empirical side, a vast cross-country econometric literature has aimed to identify the causes of civil war. While most work is plagued by econometric identification problems, low per capita incomes, slow economic growth and geographic conditions favoring insurgency are the factors most robustly linked to civil war. We argue that microlevel analysis and data are needed to truly decipher war's causes, and understand the recruitment, organization, and conduct of armed groups. Recent advances in this area are highlighted. Finally, turning to the economic legacies of war, we frame the literature in terms of neoclassical economic growth theory. Emerging stylized facts include the ability of some economies to experience rapid macroeconomic recoveries, while certain human capital impacts appear more persistent. Yet econometric identification has not been adequately addressed, and there is little consensus on the most effective policies to avert conflicts or promote postwar recovery. The evidence is weakest where it is arguably most important: in understanding civil wars' effects on institutions, technology, and social norms.},

  Abstract                 = {It is very common to analyse the factors associated with the onset and continuation of civil wars entirely separately, as if there were likely to be no similarity between them. This is an overstatement of the theoretical position, which has established only that they may be different (i.e. less than perfectly correlated). The hypothesis that the explanatory variables are the same is not theoretically excludable and is empirically testable, both for individual variables and for combinations of them. Starting from this approach yields a rather different picture of the factors associated with the continuation of civil wars, because the relatively small sample size means that confidence intervals on individual coefficients are wide in this case. It is shown here that country size, mountainous terrain and (in most datasets) ethnic diversity seem significant for the continuation of civil wars, starting from the null hypothesis that variables affect onset and continuation probabilities identically, rather than entirely independently. One variable that affects onset and continuation significantly differently is anocracy, which we find to matter only for onset. Civil war is more likely if it occurred two years previously, as well as one year previously, which indicates that wars are more likely to restart after only one year of peace, and also more likely to stop in their first year. The combined model strengthens the result that ethnic diversity matters (it is consistently significant across datasets, whereas it is not when onset is analysed separately), although in the UCD/PRIO dataset it is significant only for onset. By contrast, if continuation is analysed independently, virtually nothing is significant except a pre-1991 dummy and a dummy for civil war two years previously.},

These real-world developments have spawned a huge new scholarly literature on central bank communication -- mostly empirical, and almost all of it written in this decade. We survey this ever-growing literature. The evidence suggests that communication can be an important and powerful part of the central bank's toolkit since it has the ability to move financial markets, to enhance the predictability of monetary policy decisions, and potentially to help achieve central banks' macroeconomic objectives. However, the large variation in communication strategies across central banks suggests that a consensus has yet to emerge on what constitutes an optimal communication strategy.},

  Abstract                 = {Many liberals believe that shared democracy can be a foundation for peace not only directly, but indirectly through increased trade between countries as well. We test the hypothesis that democratic states will conduct more trade with each other by relating pairs of states' trade to their political regime type, official language, openness to trade, alliance status, and the presence of militarized disputes, as well as to the states' gross domestic product and the distance between them. We report analyses for 882 dyads from 1962 to 1989 and for 1,042 dyads from 1973 to 1989. Our results provide strong support for the hypothesis that shared democratic polity, common language, and openness to trade are associated with higher values of international trade.},

  Abstract                 = {We examine the formation of networks among a set of players whose payoffs depend on the structure of the network, when players may bargain by promising or demanding transfer payments when forming links. We vary three aspects of the game: (i) whether players can only make transfers to (and receive transfers from) players to whom they are directly linked, or whether they can also subsidize links that they are not directly involved in, (ii) whether or not transfers relating to a given link can be made contingent on the full resulting network or only on the link itself, and (iii) whether or not players can pay other players to refrain from forming links. We characterize the networks that are supported under these variations and show how each of the above aspects either accounts for a specific type of externality, or deals with the combinatorial nature of network payoffs.},

  Abstract                 = {We propose and test two ways in which retaliation threats may dampen the antidumping (AD) activity we observe. First, the threat of retaliatory AD actions may make a domestic industry less likely to name a foreign import source in an AD petition. Second, the prospect of a GATT/WTO trade dispute may make government agencies less likely to rule positive in their AD decision. Using a nested logit framework, we find evidence that both retaliation threats substantially affect US AD activity from 1980 through 1998.},

We find analytical expressions for the main topological properties of these models as a function of the distribution of hidden variables and the probability of connecting vertices. The expressions obtained are checked by means of numerical simulations in a particular example. The general model is extended to describe a practical algorithm to generate random networks with an \textit{a priori} specified correlation structure. We also present an extension of the class, to map non-equilibrium growing networks to networks with hidden variables that represent the time at which each vertex was introduced in the system.},

Supply-side economic strategies are a function of the party in office. Left-wing governments spend heavily in physical and human capital formation to raise the productivity of factors and the competitiveness of the economy. Right-wing governments rely instead on private agents to maximize economic growth. The organization of the domestic political economy and the international economy, which place heavy limits on the capacity of parties to affect the conduct of macro-economic policies, hardly constrain the choice of supply-side economic strategies. Regression analysis of data for levels of public spending on gross fixed capital formation and on education in OECD nations from 1960 to 1990. Supply-side policies conform to partisan preferences throughout the period examined. The institutional configuration of the economy affected policies jointly with government partisanship until the oil shock but not afterwards. Economic openness does not constrain the choice of supply-side policies.},

  Abstract                 = {The authors show that economic development increases the probability that a country will undergo a transition to democracy. These results contradict the finding of Przeworski and his associates, that development causes democracy to last but not to come into existence in the first place. By dealing adequately with problems of sample selection and model specification, the authors discover that economic growth does cause nondemocraciesto democratize. They show that the effect of economic development on the probability of a transition to democracy in the hundred years between the mid-nineteenth century and World War II was substantial, indeed, even stronger than its effect on democratic stability.They also show that, in more recent decades, some countries that developed but remained dictatorships would, because of their development, be expected to democratize in as few as three years after achieving a per capita income of \$12,000 per capita.},

  Abstract                 = {The Multinomial Probit (MNP) formulation provides a very general framework to allow for inter-dependent alternatives in discrete choice analysis. Up until recently, its use was rather limited, mainly because of the computational difficulties associated with the evaluation of the choice probabilities which are multidimensional normal integrals. In recent years, the econometric estimation of Multinomial Probit models has greatly been focused on. Alternative simulation based approaches have been suggested and compared. Most approaches exploit a conventional estimation technique where easy to compute simulators replace the choice probabilities. For situations such as in transportation demand modelling where samples and choice sets are large, the existing literature clearly suggests the use of a maximum simulated likelihood (MSL) framework combined with a Geweke-Hajivassiliou-Keane (GHK) choice probability simulator. The present paper gives the computational details regarding the implementation of this practical estimation approach where the scores are computed analytically. This represents a contribution of the paper, because usually, numerical derivatives are used. The approach is tested on a 9-mode transportation choice model estimated with disaggregate data from Santiago, Chile.},

Although their convertibility into gold ended at the end of that year, they remained acceptable for tariff payment at a par with gold coin while they were gradually replaced with paper money that did not share this provision, the Greenbacks. We present daily observations of exchange rates between the Notes, Greenbacks, and gold for the extended period during which they simultaneously circulated. These exchange rates substantiate our revisionist notion that the Notes were replaced because the tariff provision prevented them from generating sufficient seigniorage for wartime needs.

This chapter offers a brief history and theory of the politicization of premillennialism in the American context and using social network analysis examines the relationship between this phenomenon and preference for policy positions on Israel, secularization, globalization, environmentalism and government regulation. Web-based network analysis which offers both an important methodological tool and a theoretical paradigm is used to examine the social structures of premillennial websites and their relationship to the policies implicit in the narrative of premillennialism. Increasingly, the World Wide Web has come to represent a virtual forum for the exchange of ideas; connecting website creators to specific and knowledgeable issue publics, as well as informing audiences about and converting them to new points of view. Using the IssueCrawler program I performed a co-link (relational) analysis. Three separate networks will be examined: Christian Right Elite Network, Beliefnet Black Spiritual Leader Network, and a Issue Centric Network. The networks are examined for evidence of premillennial policy positions to ascertain whether or not elites link their online audiences to the policy positions implicit in the premillennial narrative.},

Examination of data from nine widely different capital-importing countries, using a model inspired by the Capital Asset Pricing Model, reveals that countries with poor records of adherence were charged considerably more than those with good records, enough to explain the determined effort to stay on gold made by a number of capital-importing countries. },

  Abstract                 = {Centrality measures, or at least popular interpretations of these measures, make implicit assumptions about the manner in which traffic flows through a network. For example, some measures count only geodesic paths, apparently assuming that whatever flows through the network only moves along the shortest possible paths. This paper lays out a typology of network flows based on two dimensions of variation, namely the kinds of trajectories that traffic may follow (geodesics, paths, trails, or walks) and the method of spread (broadcast, serial replication, or transfer). Measures of centrality are then matched to the kinds of flows that they are appropriate for. Simulations are used to examine the relationship between type of flow and the differential importance of nodes with respect to key measurements such as speed of reception of traffic and frequency of receiving traffic. It is shown that the off-the-shelf formulas for centrality measures are fully applicable only for the specific flow processes they are designed for, and that when they are applied to other flow processes they get the #wrong# answer. It is noted that the most commonly used centrality measures are not appropriate for most of the flows we are routinely interested in. A key claim made in this paper is that centrality measures can be regarded as generating expected values for certain kinds of node outcomes (such as speed and frequency of reception) given implicit models of how traffic flows, and that this provides a new and useful way of thinking about centrality.},

We use random networks of varying sizes and densities and subject them (separately) to four kinds of random error in varying amounts. The types of error are edge deletion, node deletion, edge addition, and node addition. The results show that the accuracy of centrality measures declines smoothly and predictably with the amount of error. This suggests that, for random networks and random error, we shall be able to construct confidence intervals around centrality scores. In addition, centrality measures were highly similar in their response to error. Dense networks were the most robust in the face of all kinds of error except edge deletion. For edge deletion, sparse networks were more accurately measured.},

  Abstract                 = {The concept of centrality is often invoked in social network analysis, and diverse indices have been proposed to measure it. This paper develops a unified framework for the measurement of centrality. All measures of centrality assess a node's involvement in the walk structure of a network. Measures vary along four key dimensions: type of nodal involvement assessed, type of walk considered, property of walk assessed, and choice of summary measure. If we cross-classify measures by type of nodal involvement (radial versus medial) and property of walk assessed (volume versus length), we obtain a four-fold polychotomization with one cell empty which mirrors Freeman's 1979 categorization. At a more substantive level, measures of centrality summarize a node's involvement in or contribution to the cohesiveness of the network. Radial measures in particular are reductions of pair-wise proximities/cohesion to attributes of nodes or actors. The usefulness and interpretability of radial measures depend on the fit of the cohesion matrix to the one-dimensional model. In network terms, a network that is fit by a one-dimensional model has a core-periphery structure in which all nodes revolve more or less closely around a single core. This in turn implies that the network does not contain distinct cohesive subgroups. Thus, centrality is shown to be intimately connected with the cohesive subgroup structure of a network.},

For social scientists, the theory of networks has been a gold mine, yielding explanations for social phenomena in a wide variety of disciplines from psychology to economics. Here, we review the kinds of things that social scientists have tried to explain using social network analysis and provide a nutshell description of the basic assumptions, goals, and explanatory mechanisms prevalent in the field. We hope to contribute to a dialogue among researchers from across the physical and social sciences who share a common interest in understanding the antecedents and consequences of network phenomena.},

  Abstract                 = {We provide an empirical analysis of the network structure of the Austrian interbank market based on a unique data set of the Oesterreichische Nationalbank (OeNB). We show that the contract size distribution follows a power law over more than 3 decades. By using a novel ???dissimilarity??? measure we find that the interbank network shows a community structure that exactly mirrors the regional and sectoral organization of the actual Austrian banking system. The degree distribution of the interbank network shows two different power-law exponents that are one-to-one related to two sub-network structures, differing in the degree of hierarchical organization. The banking network moreover shares typical structural features known in numerous complex real world networks: a low clustering coefficient and a relatively short average shortest path length. These empirical findings are in marked contrast to interbank networks that have been analyzed in the theoretical economic and econo-physics literature.},

They call for an approach to index construction that relies on case expertise and use of a wide range of data sources, and they employ this approach in developing an index of political democracy for the Central American countries during the 20th century. The authorsâ index draws on a comprehensive set of secondary and primary sources as it rigorously pursues standards of conceptualization, operationalization, and aggregation. The indexâs value is illustrated by showing how it suggests new lines of research in the field of Central American politics.},

  Abstract                 = {Abstract A detailed data base of the Ardennes campaign of World War II (December 15, 1944 through January 16, 1945) has recently been developed. The present article formulates four Lanchester models of the campaign and estimates their parameters for these data. Two-sided time histories of warfare on battles and campaigns are very rare, so Lanchester models have seldom been validated with historical data. The models are homogeneous in that tanks, armored personnel carriers, artillery, and manpower are weighted to yield a measure of strength of the Allied and German forces. This weighting is utilized for combat power and for losses. The models treat combat forces in the campaign (including infantry, armor, and artillery manpower) and total forces in the campaign (including both combat manpower and support manpower.) Four models are presented. Two models have five parameters (Allied individual effectiveness, German individual effectiveness, exponent of shooting force, exponent of target force, and a tactical parameter reflecting which side is defending and attacking.) The other two models remove the tactical parameter, which is not generally known prior to warfare, and estimate the other parameters without the tactical parameter. The main results of the research are (a) the Lanchester linear model fits the Ardennes campaign data in all four cases, and (b) when combat forces are considered Allied individual effectiveness is greater than German individual effectiveness, whereas when total forces are considered Allied and German individual effectiveness is the same. The interpretation of the latter result is that the two sides had essentially the same individual capabilities but were organized differentlyâthe Allies chose to have more manpower in the support forces, which yielded greater individual capabilities in the combat forces. The overall superiority of the Allies in the campaign led to the attrition to the Allies being a smaller portion of their forces.

  Abstract                 = {This article analyzes the processes of distribution and redistribution in postindustrial democracies. The authors combine a pooled time-series data base on welfare state effort and its determinants assembled by Huber, Ragin, and Stephens (1997) with data on income distribution assembled in the Luxembourg Income Survey (lis) archive. In the case of the lis data, the authors recalculate the microdata in order to remove the distorting influence of pensioners on pretax, pretransfer income distribution. They examine the determinants of two dependent variables: pretax, pretransfer income inequality and the proportional reduction in inequality from pre- to post-tax and transfer inequality. They test hypotheses derived from power resources theory against alternatives derived from the literature on the development of the welfare state and the determinants of income inequality. The results offer strong support for power resources theory, particularly in the case of reduction in inequality. Union density, unemployment, and percentage of female-headed households were the main determinants of pre-tax and transfer inequality (R2 = .64), while leftist government, directly and indirectly through its influence on the size of the welfare state, was found to be by far the strongest determinant of distribution (R2 = .81).},

The authors by and large agree on the nature of science and the variety of ways to do it, but they disagree on the most fruitful way to proceed at this moment. Granato and Scioli believe that we need to do more to test theories with data and to formulate theories that are based on data. We need, in their phrase, to consider the empirical implications of theoretical models (EITM). Rogers Smith thinks we need to take history, context, and meaning more seriously in order to understand phenomena such as political identity.Henry E.

The differentiated sector is characterized by multi-stage production, with increasing returns at the corporate level associated with some activity such as R&D, scale economics at the plant level, and a variable transport cost that rises with distance. A pure multinational equilibrium, where two-way horizontal expansion across borders completely supplants two-way trade in differentiated products, is possible even in the absence of factor proportion differences. It is more likely the greater are transport costs relative to fixed plant costs, and the greater are increasing returns at the corporate level relative to the plant level. The model also establishes conditions for a mixed equilibrium, in which national and multinational firms coexist.},

  Abstract                 = {Multiplicative interaction models are common in the quantitative political science literature. This is so for good reason. Institutional arguments frequently imply that the relationship between political inputs and outcomes varies depending on the institutional context. Models of strategic interaction typically produce conditional hypotheses as well. Although conditional hypotheses are ubiquitous in political science and multiplicative interaction models have been found to capture their intuition quite well, a survey of the top three political science journals from 1998 to 2002 suggests that the execution of these models is often flawed and inferential errors are common. We believe that considerable progress in our understanding of the political world can occur if scholars follow the simple checklist of dos and don'ts for using multiplicative interaction models presented in this article. Only 10\% of the articles in our survey followed the checklist.},

  Abstract                 = {This paper examines experimentation and innovation when experimental results diffuse along social links. This public-goods nature of experimentation is a feature of many areas of economics, such as consumer choice, research and development, and agriculture. The paper asks: How do different patterns of social and geographic links affect experimentation? Who experiments and who free rides? Do more links enhance or diminish social welfare? The analysis finds, first, that social networks can foster specialization. In every social network there is an equilibrium where some individuals experiment and others completely free-ride. In many networks this extreme is the only equilibrium outcome. Second, specialization can benefit society as a whole. This outcome arises when specialists are linked, collectively, to many agents. Finally, new links can reduce overall welfare. A new link increases access to new results, but also reduces an individualÃ¢â¬â¢s incentives to conduct his own experiments. Hence, overall welfare can be higher when there are holes in a network.},

  Abstract                 = {A procedure for reaching agreement on multilateral treaties, based on âfallback bargaining,â is proposed. The compromise it finds minimizes the maximum distance, called the Hamming distance, between it and the top preferences of all players. This compromise may differ from the compromise produced by the usual procedureâvoting on each treaty provisionâwhich minimizes the sum of distances. The proposed procedure is relatively invulnerable to strategizing, inducing players to be truthful in expressing their preferences. The application of the procedure requires that issues be of more or less equal significance to countries and that they be as independent as possible. Applying the procedure to oil-pollution control negotiations among 32 countries in 1954 yields six compromise outcomes, all different from that produced by the usual procedure. Approval voting is suggested as a way to break ties among the compromise outcomes.},

  Abstract                 = {Bayesian approaches to the study of politics are increasingly popular. But Bayesian approaches to modeling multiple time series have not been critically evaluated. This is in spite of the potential value of these models in international relations, political economy, and other fields of our discipline. We review recent developments in Bayesian multi-equation time series modeling in theory testing, forecasting, and policy analysis. Methods for constructing Bayesian measures of uncertainty of impulse responses (Bayesian shape error bands) are explained. A reference prior for these models that has proven useful in short- and medium-term forecasting in macroeconomics is described. Once modified to incorporate our experience analyzing political data and our theories, this prior can enhance our ability to forecast over the short and medium terms complex political dynamics like those exhibited by certain international conflicts. In addition, we explain how contingent Bayesian forecasts can be constructed, contingent Bayesian forecasts that embody policy counterfactuals. The value of these new Bayesian methods is illustrated in a reanalysis of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict of the 1980s.},

We combine the CAMEO event-coding framework with Markov-switching and Bayesian vector autoregression models to meet these goals. Our example produces a series of forecasts for material conflict between the Israelis and Palestinians for 2010. Our forecast is that the level of material conflict between these belligerents will increase in 2010, compared to 2009.},

(American Journal of Political Science 44(4):823â843, 2000). We develop an alternative model for stationary mean reverting data, the Poisson autoregressive model of order p, or PAR(p) model. Issues of identification and model selection are also considered. We then evaluate the properties of this model and present both Monte Carlo evidence and applications to illustrate.},

  Abstract                 = {This article builds on the recent policy diffusion literature and attempts to overcome one of its major problems, namely the lack of a coherent theoretical framework. The literature defines policy diffusion as a process where policy choices are interdependent, and identifies several diffusion mechanisms that specify the link between the policy choices of the various actors. As these mechanisms are grounded in different theories, theoretical accounts of diffusion currently have little internal coherence. In this article we put forward an expected-utility model of policy change that is able to subsume all the diffusion mechanisms. We argue that the expected utility of a policy depends on both its effectiveness and the payoffs it yields, and we show that the various diffusion mechanisms operate by altering these two parameters. Each mechanism affects one of the two parameters, and does so in distinct ways. To account for aggregate patterns of diffusion, we embed our model in a simple threshold model of diffusion. Given the high complexity of the process that results, strong analytical conclusions on aggregate patterns cannot be drawn without more extensive analysis which is beyond the scope of this article. However, preliminary considerations indicate that a wide range of diffusion processes may exist and that convergence is only one possible outcome.},

  Abstract                 = {This paper develops econometric models for discrete games. Specifically, we model the payoffs of games where a researcher observes qualitative or censored information about agents' decisions and payoffs. These models extend single-person qualitative choice models introduced by McFadden (1974) and others to multiple-person choice problems. The equations describing players' equilibrium strategies depend on the game's structure and the equilibrium solution concept. We show that one can describe the equilibria of a simultaneous-move Nash game with a linear system of dummy endogenous variables. We also show that sequential-move and cooperative models have different, but related, econometric structures. A series of applied examples address identification and estimation issues. These examples include models of market entry, technology adoption, tax auditing, and cooperative family labor supply.},

  Abstract                 = {In this paper, we present Google, a prototype of a large-scale search engine which makes heavy use of the structure present in hypertext. Google is designed to crawl and index the Web efficiently and produce much more satisfying search results than existing systems. The prototype with a full text and hyperlink database of at least 24 million pages is available at http://google.stanford.edu/ To engineer a search engine is a challenging task. Search engines index tens to hundreds of millions of web pages involving a comparable number of distinct terms. They answer tens of millions of queries every day. Despite the importance of large-scale search engines on the web, very little academic research has been done on them. Furthermore, due to rapid advance in technology and web proliferation, creating a web search engine today is very different from three years ago. This paper provides an in-depth description of our large-scale web search engine -- the first such detailed public description we know of to date. Apart from the problems of scaling traditional search techniques to data of this magnitude, there are new technical challenges involved with using the additional information present in hypertext to produce better search results. This paper addresses this question of how to build a practical large-scale system which can exploit the additional information present in hypertext. Also we look at the problem of how to effectively deal with uncontrolled hypertext collections where anyone can publish anything they want.},

Countries act as rational agents concerned with both consumption and the public bad of a war. In the first period both countries can either consume or build arms, whereas in the second period there can be either the threat or the use of force to reallocate resources. If both countries are fully informed, then there will be no war but rather a voluntary redistribution of resources. In a situation of asymmetric information, however, in which one country is fully informed and the other is not, a war can occur if the uninformed country uses a separating equilibrium strategy, precommitting itself to a positive probability of war in order to prevent bluffing by the informed country.},

  Abstract                 = {As global demand for water increases but usable freshwater resources decrease, many have suggested that water scarcity is and will be an important source of armed conflict -- but little systematic research has investigated this topic. We examine the management of all shared rivers in the Americas, Western Europe, and the Middle East, seeking to understand both the outbreak of explicit disagreements over the use of rivers ("river claims") and the militarization of these claims. We argue that increasing water scarcity and water demands make states more likely to begin river claims and to begin militarized conflict over these claims, but that treaties can help to prevent both the emergence and militarization of river claims. Empirical analysis with rare events logit models indicates that greater levels of water scarcity and greater demands on water increase the risk of both claim onset and militarization, while river treaties have mixed effects on claim onset but significantly reduce militarization. We conclude by discussing implications for future research in this area.},

  Abstract                 = {The theoretical debate over whether countries can and should set tariffs in response to the foreign export elasticities they face goes back to Edgeworth (1894). Despite the centrality of the optimal tariff argument in trade policy, there exists no evidence about whether countries actually exploit their market power in trade by setting higher tariffs on goods that are supplied inelastically. We estimate disaggregate foreign export supply elasticities and find evidence that countries that are not members of the World Trade Organization systematically set higher tariffs on goods that are supplied inelastically. The typical country in our sample sets tariffs 9 percentage points higher in goods with high market power relative to those with low market power. This large effect is of a magnitude similar to the average tariffs in the data and market power explains more of the tariff variation than a commonly used political economy variable. The result is robust to the inclusion of other determinants of tariffs and a variety of model specifications. We also find that U.S. trade restrictions that are not covered by the WTO are significantly higher in goods where the U.S. has more market power. In short, we find strong evidence that these importers have market power and use it in setting non-cooperative trade policy.},

  Abstract                 = {Using a unique and comprehensive dataset, this paper develops and uses three distinct methods to quantify the risk of a systemic failure in the global banking system. We examine a sample of 334 banks (representing 80\% of global bank equity) in 28 countries around 6 global financial crises (such as the Asian and Russian crises and September 11, 2001), and show that these crises did not create large probabilities of global financial system failure. First, we show that cumulative negative abnormal returns for the subset of banks not directly exposed to a negative shock (unexposed banks) rarely exceed a few percent. Second, we use structural models to obtain more precise point estimates of the likelihood of systemic failure. These estimates suggest that systemic risk is limited even during major financial crises. For example, maximum likelihood estimation of bank failure probabilities implied by equity prices suggests the Asian crisis induced less than a 1\% increase in the probability of systemic failure. Third, we also obtain estimates of systemic risk implied by equity option prices of U.S. and European banks. The largest values are obtained for the Russian crisis and September 11 and these show increases in estimated average default probabilities of only around 1-2\%. Taken together our results suggest statistically significant, but economically small, increases in systemic risk around even the worst financial crises of the last 10 years. Although policy responses are endogenous, the low estimated probabilities suggest that the distress of central bankers, regulators and politicians about the events we study may be overstated, and that current policy responses to financial crises and the existing institutional framework may be adequate to handle major macroeconomic events.},

  Abstract                 = {The problem of variable selection in regression and the generalised linear model is addressed. We adopt a Bayesian approach with priors for the regression coefficients that are scale mixtures of normal distributions and embody a high prior probability of proximity to zero. By seeking modal estimates we generalise the lasso. Properties of the priors and their resultant posteriors are explored in the context of the linear and generalised linear model especially when there are more variables than observations. We develop EM algorithms that embrace the need to explore the multiple modes of the non log-concave posterior distributions. Finally we apply the technique to microarray data using a probit model to find the genetic predictors of osteo- versus rheumatoid arthritis.},

We isolate both structural breaks and turning points in these bond series. Major turning points follow Hiderâs reintroduction of conscription in 1935, the outbreak of war in 1939 and the D-Day invasion of June 1944. The German bondsâ sustained downward trend after 1935 suggests that bondholders recognized the risks posed by Hitlerâs programme. Bond prices recovered during the war, however, and appear to have anticipated the overthrow of Hitler and the postwar settlement of foreign bondholdersâ claims.},

The analysis suggests that the turning points important to Southern interests differ from those identified for the Northern side by Kristen Willard, Timothy Guinnane, and Harvey Rosen. It seems that war news did not always have symmetric effects on North and South.},

  Abstract                 = {Why do states delegate certain tasks and responsibilities to international organizations rather than acting unilaterally or cooperating directly? Furthermore, to what extent do states continue to control IOs once authority has been delegated? Examining a variety of different institutions including the World Trade Organization, the United Nations and the European Commission, this book explores the different methods that states employ to ensure their interests are being served, and identifies the problems involved with monitoring and managing IOs. The contributors suggest that it is not inherently more difficult to design effective delegation mechanisms at international level than at domestic level and, drawing on principal-agent theory, help explain the variations that exist in the extent to which states are willing to delegate to IOs. They argue that IOs are neither all evil nor all virtuous, but are better understood as bureaucracies that can be controlled to varying degrees by their political masters. },

Using a new dataset on capital account policy available for 173 countries over the period 1973-1999, our analysis yields five primary findings. First, consistent with the Mundell-Fleming approach to open economy macroeconomics, countries with fixed exchange rates tend to have less open capital accounts. Second, capital accounts remain more closed in less developed countries. Third, integration into the international economy is associated with capital account liberalization. Fourth, government spending and open capital accounts go hand-in-hand in developed countries, whereas countries with larger public economies tend to have less open capital accounts in the developing world. Finally, democracy promotes capital account liberalization, particularly in developing countries.},

  Abstract                 = {Over the past two decades, many developing countries have removed restrictions on the movement of capital flows across their borders. An emerging literature argues that rather than the result of independent processes, these policy changes were interdependent and diffused through networks of peers via the mechanisms of competition and emulation. This paper strengthens the diffusion arguments in the case of financial liberalization both theoretically and empirically. Theoretically, we argue for diffusion as mechanism for globalization rather than simply the result of globalization and we provide a mechanism for distinguishing diffusion via competition from diffusion via emulation. Empirically, we strengthen the case for diffusion by testing diffusion hypotheses on specific policy measures rather than pooled heterogeneous measures of openness. Based on panel data for 117 emerging economies over the period 1970- 2002, our results suggest that diffusion has played a role in developing countriesÃ¢â¬â¢ decision to liberalize; the results are not dependent on levels of economic integration, and that diffusion networks previously thought to identify the emulation process may in fact be capturing diffusion via competition.},

  Abstract                 = {Terming a specific approach to economics agent-based may appear paradoxical. IsnÃ¢â¬â¢t human behavior the foundation of economics - and shouldnÃ¢â¬â¢t all economic theory be based on agents behavior in some sense? This, at least, is what conventional economic theory has been claiming since the 1970Ã¢â¬â¢s. In this introduction we shall argue that agent-based computational economics (ACE) allows agents and especially their interaction, a more pivotal role than does conventional microeconomics or microfounded theory. There is a difference between microeconomics and agent-based economics - in the latter you are not satisfied with understanding exactly how a single agent acts in economic markets - you are primarily interested in the system view that arises when you observe the interaction between a number of agents. From observing an isolated agent, it is impossible to foresee what happens when a multitude of agents interact - it cannot be deduced. This adds importance to the computational part. In agent-based economics the computer is not merely used as a giant calculator finding analytical or numerical solutions, but is used as a central part in a new methodological approach to economics.},

  Abstract                 = {Policy scorings of political actors are crucially important in operationalising rational choice models and other important theories in political science. Doing them more cheaply and quickly by computer is important for the advancement of the discipline. But we can hardly substitute these for hand-coding or even use them in new fields without being sure of their validity and reliability. We check this by comparing the mappings produced by word frequency methods with the policy series available from the work of the Manifesto Research Group/Comparative Manifesto Project (MRG/CMP). Using an aggregate calibrating/reference [`]document set' for the time period in question evades reliability problems with pairwise comparisons and provides an authoritative text which enables individual party platforms to be scored and mapped over long time periods. Comparisons of the techniques for two countries (US and UK) are not encouraging. Wordscores in their current operationalisation flatten out party movement just as previous computerised approaches have done. Sensitivity testing with British party manifestos 1979-1997, using an expert scoring, does not reveal any improvement in performance. The reliability problems which arise with policy series are also likely to recur with cross-sectional applications of the word frequency approach.},

  Abstract                 = {The expected utility framework developed in The War Trap is revised to correct several deficiencies. Risk-taking orientations are now treated as an integral part of the model by introducing concavity or convexity into the utility functions. The zero-sum properties of the theory are largely eliminated, and the tendency toward interpersonal comparisons of utility is removed. Several earlier results are replicated with the new model, and with annual capabilities data. New propositions are deduced that identify important limitations on conflict initiation, and relationships resulting from differences in perceptions are tested. Support is found for the contention that the revised version of the theory, of which the original model is a special case, is a powerful tool for integrating many extant hypotheses about conflict and for explaining a substantial portion of the tendency for some threats to escalate to violence or warfare and for others to be resolved peacefully.},

  Abstract                 = {The authors advance a theory of the effects of political institutions on state policy. The theory explains how political institutions affect the ability of leaders to maintain themselves in office, why some political systems are more prone to policy failure than others, and why autocrats create mass political systems. The key characteristics of institutions in this theory are the sizes of a polity's selectorate and winning coalition. The authors derive hypotheses from the theory and test those hypotheses using a data set covering more than 2,700 leaders from all states in the period from 1816 to 1990. The statistical tests demonstrate that (1) large winning coalitions are associated with enhanced economic growth, (2) tenure is shortened by a large winning coalition but lengthened by a large selectorate, and (3) in the face of policy failure, leaders with a large selectorate are more likely to survive than those in systems with a large winning coalition. The authors conclude by discussing the implications of these results.},

  Abstract                 = {We examine formally the link between domestic political institutions and policy choices in the context of eight empirical regularities that constitute the democratic peace. We demonstrate that democratic leaders, when faced with war, are more inclined to shift extra resources into the war effort than are autocrats. This follows because the survival of political leaders with larger winning coalitions hinges on successful policy. The extra effort made by democrats provides a military advantage over autocrats. This makes democrats unattractive targets, since their institutional constraints cause them to mobilize resources for the war effort. In addition to trying harder, democrats are more selective in their choice of targets. Because defeat is more likely to lead to domestic replacement for democrats than for autocrats, democrats only initiate wars they expect to win. These two factors lead to the interaction between polities that is often referred to as the democratic peace.},

  Abstract                 = {The authors of this ambitious book address a fundamental political question: why are leaders who produce peace and prosperity turned out of office while those who preside over corruption, war, and misery endure? Considering this political puzzle, they also answer the related economic question of why some countries experience successful economic development and others do not. The authors construct a provocative theory on the selection of leaders and present specific formal models from which their central claims can be deduced. They show how political leaders allocate resources and how institutions for selecting leaders create incentives for leaders to pursue good and bad public policy. They also extend the model to explain the consequences of war on political survival. Throughout the book, they provide illustrations from history, ranging from ancient Sparta to Vichy France, and test the model against statistics gathered from cross-national data. The authors explain the political intuition underlying their theory in nontechnical language, reserving formal proofs for chapter appendixes. They conclude by presenting policy prescriptions based on what has been demonstrated theoretically and empirically.},

However, there has never been any formal statistical analysis of the inflationary consequences of its monetary and fiscal policies. This paper utilizes data from the original Treasury reports to investigate the implications of war-induced fiscal expansion for debt and note issues, and for the inflation rate. The former are found to be influenced primarily by the state of the Confederate budget, while the inflation rate appears to be driven by a "confidence" index tied to developments on the military front.},

Yet most cases are settled beforehand in informal consultations. This article tests two sets of hypotheses about the decision to escalate GATT cases, one concerning the significance of the right to a panel, the other concerning the effects of political regime type. Results show that the right to a panel did not inspire more early settlement, more escalation, or more resolution through concessions at the panel stage; however, highly democratic dyads are more likely to achieve concession, but only at the consultation stage. This suggests that a strategy of tying hands, rather than adherence to legal (and other) norms of conflict resolution, is likely to shed light on the way democracies use formal third-party adjudication at GATT.},

This gives rise to forum shopping, in that complainants can file regionally, multilaterally, or not at all. What explains this choice of forum? I argue that complainants strategically discriminate among overlapping memberships: on a given measure(s), some prefer to set a precedent that bears only on a subset of their trade relations, others a precedent that bears on all their trade relations, while still others prefer not to set a precedent. Thus, the key to forum shopping is not simply which institution is likely to come closest to the complainant's ideal ruling against the defendant, but where the resulting precedent will be more useful in the future, enabling the complainant to bring litigation against other members, rather than helping other members bring litigation against the complainant. I consider disputes over Mexican brooms and Canadian periodicals.},

  Abstract                 = {The debate over the relationship between the location of industry and the incidence of import barriers has been miscast. Three problems call into question the findings reported in the endogenous protection literature. First, geographic concentration is widely used as a proxy for political concentration (i.e., the spread of industry across political districts), although these two variables are conceptually and empirically distinct. Second, extant measures of geographic concentration ignore the spatial relationship among units (e.g., counties or states) in which "lumpy" industries make their home, thereby often failing to detect concentration where it exists. Third, in those few studies in which political concentration receives any direct attention at all, nonmonotonic effects and interaction terms are seldom tested, despite their grounding in theories of interest group politics more generally. This article addresses all three problems. The results indicate that geographically concentrated but politically dispersed industries are the ones most likely to receive relief from imports, although a handful of very large industries benefit from being politically concentrated. The article thus reveals how to reconcile the two competing hypotheses around which one of endogenous protection theory's most enduring debates has taken shape.},

  Abstract                 = {Does legal capacity â the institutional resources required to prepare and prosecute disputes â matter in the World Trade Organization? Many observers have emphasised that, under the WTOâs legalistic dispute settlement regime, âright perseveres over might,â trumping the role that might otherwise be played by power politics. Yet others have stressed that there can be a downside to greater legalism. WTO members can only take advantage of the rule of law if they can effectively pursue their rights in its complex legal regime, and this depends, in part, on having adequately experienced legal, economic, and diplomatic staff, working within an institutional context supported from home. To varying degrees, developing countries, in particular, lack such legal capacity, making it hard for them to fully participate in WTO dispute settlement, and jeopardising their confidence in the multilateral trade regime. For all the attention the subject has received, however, there has been no systematic assessment of legal capacity and virtually no empirical evidence about how it affects patterns of trade disputes and import protection. Our paper seeks to redress this gap. To this end, with support from the National Science Foundation (NSF) and the generous assistance of the International Centre for Trade and Sustainable Development (ICTSD), we conducted an original survey of WTO delegations on issues bearing on legal capacity. We use the survey responses to create a novel index of legal capacity directly relevant to WTO dispute settlement and the operation of domestic trade law in its shadow. Drawing on Bownâs (2006) new Global Antidumping Database (version 2.1), we examine a list of 1,321 antidumping investigations conducted during the years 1995-2005 by 17 WTO Members against firms located in 33 of the WTO member states covered in our survey. Using multivariate analyses that explicitly control for indicators of the countriesâ market power, we assess whether targets from countries that have greater WTO legal capacity are less likely to be subjected to protectionist antidumping actions at the end of those investigations. We also test whether the targeted countries are more likely to challenge antidumping measures against them before the WTO when they possess greater legal capacity. The results indicate that legal capacity plays a very powerful role in predicting whether a member is able to bring suit against adverse trade actions by its partners. Our results also show that greater legal capacity deters such adverse antidumping actions in the first place. Our study using a large number of countries thus has produced the first direct evidence that legal capacity plays a critical role in membersâ ability to benefit from the WTO regime},

  Abstract                 = {Despite the prevalence of sleep complaints among psychiatric patients, few questionnaires have been specifically designed to measure sleep quality in clinical populations. The Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) is a self-rated questionnaire which assesses sleep quality and disturbances over a 1-month time interval. Nineteen individual items generate seven "component" scores: subjective sleep quality, sleep latency, sleep duration, habitual sleep efficiency, sleep disturbances, use of sleeping medication, and daytime dysfunction. The sum of scores for these seven components yields one global score. Clinical and clinimetric properties of the PSQI were assessed over an 18-month period with "good" sleepers (healthy subjects, n = 52) and "poor" sleepers (depressed patients, n = 54; sleep-disorder patients, n = 62). Acceptable measures of internal homogeneity, consistency (test-retest reliability), and validity were obtained. A global PSQI score greater than 5 yielded a diagnostic sensitivity of 89.6\% and specificity of 86.5\% (kappa = 0.75, p less than 0.001) in distinguishing good and poor sleepers. The clinimetric and clinical properties of the PSQI suggest its utility both in psychiatric clinical practice and research activities.},

The U.S. Supreme Court is one institution where sophisticated voting should be common, but, paradoxically, where scholarly consensus about its existence has yet to emerge. We develop and test a formal model of sophisticated voting on agenda setting in the Supreme Court. Using data on petitions for certiorari decided in October term 1982, we show that, above and beyond the usual forces in case selection, justices engage in sophisticated voting, defined as looking forward to the decision on the merits and acting with that potential outcome in mind, and do so in a wide range of circumstances. In particular, we present strong evidence for sophisticated behavior, ranging from votes to deny a case one prefers to reverse to votes to grant cases one prefers to affirm. More importantly, sophisticated voting makes a substantial difference in the size and content of the Court's plenary agenda.},

  Abstract                 = {Theory: We argue that levels of concurrence and dissent on the U.S. Supreme Court are functions of "consensual norms." These norms arise from, and are influenced by, the behaviors of the individual justices, including the actions of the chief justices. In turn, they cause concurrences and dissents to fluctuate around a common level. Hypotheses: If consensual norms are a substantial influence on the behavior of the Court, the long-run extent of concurrence and dissent on the Court will covary substantially, and will do so to varying degrees under different chief justices. Methods: To test our hypotheses, we use cointegration and error-correction analyses of the number of Supreme Court cases from 1800 to 1991 with concurring and dissenting opinions. Because of the dramatic increase in concurrences and dissents during the 1940s, we make use of recently-developed methods for detecting cointegrating relationships in the presence of structural breaks. Results: Consistent with our expectations, dissents and concurrences move together over time; thus consensual norms appear to influence substantially both concurrences and dissents on the Court. The effects of such norms vary in the long term under different Chief Justices.},

  Abstract                 = {Leadership is a means by which social groups attempt to realize gains from cooperation, coordination, and efficient allocation. The attempt to achieve such gains gives rise to further, overarching problems of coordination. The latter problems are recurrent but are likely to vary from one situation to the next; this makes decentralized methods of solution especially difficult, and provides the ultimate reason leadership is needed, invented, and accepted. Solution of such overarching problems makes leadership possible in the basic problems in which social gains are available, including activities such as organizing, sanctioning, communicating, and allocating. The stability of leadership is based on the group's need to solve coordination problems; as a result, a leader has discretion or "power," and can get away with less-than-maximal service of group goals. This approach to understanding leadership suggests several useful techniques for the study of political leadership in particular settings.},

In our game theoretic model, a higher court cues from publicly observable case facts, the known preferences of a lower court, and its decision. The lower court attempts to enforce its own preferences, exploiting ambiguity in cases' fact patterns. In equilibrium, a conservative higher court declines to review conservative decisions from lower courts regardless of the facts of the case or the relative ideology of the judges. But a conservative higher court probabilistically reviews liberal decisions, with the "audit rate" tied to observable facts and the ideology of the lower court judge. We derive comparative static results and test them with a random sample of search-and-seizure cases appealed to the Burger Court between 1972 and 1986. The evidence broadly supports the model.},

The theory considers factors such as executive competence, challenger quality, and the likelihood that voters will learn the consequences of policy decisions before an upcoming election. We find that an executive who has information suggesting that a popular policy is contrary to voters' interests may or may not pander to voters by choosing it; under certain conditions, the executive can actually increase his probability of reelection by choosing an unpopular policy that is in the public interest. However, we also show that an executive will sometimes face electoral incentives to enact a policy that is both unpopular and contrary to voters' interests. Our theory is illustrated with examples involving President Abraham Lincoln, California Governor Earl Warren, and President Gerald Ford.},

  Abstract                 = {How does public opinion affect presidential policymaking? We address this issue by testing a diverse set of hypotheses with data concerning a set of individual policies across time. In particular, the data revolve around presidential budgetary proposals on a set of major policy issues for which there are recurring surveys on citizens' preferences over spending. The analysis suggests that presidents are more responsive to mass opinion on issues that are familiar to citizens in their everyday lives. Also, for reelection-seeking presidents, responsiveness is shown to depend upon two key political factors. First, presidents are more responsive to public opinion when the next election is imminent. Second, the effect of presidential popularity is nonmonotonic; presidents with average approval ratings are most likely to adopt policy positions congruent with public opinion, whereas presidents with approval ratings that are significantly above or below average have the greatest propensity to take unpopular positions.},

  Abstract                 = {This paper studies policy changes in capital taxation by focusing on policy interdependence induced by network dynamics at the international level. The empirical findings indicate that the competition mechanism induced by network position similarity in the network of portfolio investment and that of exports causes policy diffusion in cor- porate taxation; the socialization mechanism (policy learning and emulation) induced by network position proximity in the IGO networks also drives policy changes, and the evidence is much stronger in the IGO networks that facilitate policy learning than in those that facilitate emulation. The paper also discusses explicitly empirical challenges to incorporate network characteristics into connectivity matrices in spatial lag models often used to study policy diffusion. It suggests that students of policy diffusion should discuss as explicitly as possible the assumptions and procedures to construct connectiv- ity matrices and present results from alternative specifications: our conclusion on the strength of policy diffusion is often sensitive to the choice of connectivity matrices.},

  Abstract                 = {For many, transnational capital is one of the most important driving forces of economic glob- alization; yet, we know little about what determines cross-border portfolio investments. In addi- tion to recent economic literatureâs focus on information asymmetries as one key determinant of cross-border investment, this study brings in a political aspect to the field of international trade in assets. The ârace to the bottomâ thesis connects domestic economic policies to investment deci- sions and argues that capital is more likely to move towards economies characterized by economic liberalism; political institutions are also relevant for portfolio investments, because democratic in- stitutions often provide more credible protection against predatory practices. In this study, I model bilateral portfolio investments as a function of economic policies, political institutions, and levels of transparency of sending and receiving countries as well as important international connections. Empirical findings indicate the importance of transparency to attract portfolio investments. More- over, transnational portfolio investments are only sensitive to some fiscal policy indictors and only within the OECD countries. Therefore, for non-OECD countries, there is still âroom to moveâ in maneuvering different aspects of fiscal policies. Finally, I find that investors care about the nature of political institutions as democratic institutions tend to be associated with higher levels of port- folio investment inflows. This is good news for developing countries that have undergone or are in the process of democratization. In addition to democratizing for peace, increased foreign capital further incentivizes a progression towards democratization.},

My thesis posits that economic forces of globalization impose diÃ¯Â¬â¬erential impacts on national economies depending on a country's network positions. Convergence and divergence therefore can be considered as diÃ¯Â¬â¬erent ends of a continuum. I present two hypotheses: first, the similarity in network positions induces convergence in domestic economic policies as a result of peer competitive pressure. Second, proximity in network positions facilitates policy learning and emulation which bring about policy convergence among close "neighborhoods". The empirical analysis applies a latent-space model of network analysis and indicates that network position similarity in transnational portfolio investments and network position proximity in IGO networks have been important and consistent driving forces of policy convergence.},

This contribution focus on the computation of derivatives of the log-likelihood and proposes a (comparatively!) simple and general framework, based on the use of Fisher and Louis identities, to obtain recursive equations for computing the score and observed information matrix. This approach is thought to be simpler than (although equivalent to) the solution provided by the so-called sensitivity equations. It is based on the original remark that recursive smoothers for HMMs are also available for some functional of the hidden states which do not reduce to sum functionals. This view of the problem also suggests ways in which these exact equations could be approximated using sequential Monte Carlo methods},

  Abstract                 = {One of the most common problems in machine learning and statistics consists of estimating the mean response Xβ from a vector of observations y assuming y = Xβ + ε where X is known, β is a vector of parameters of interest and ε a vector of stochastic errors. We are particularly interested here in the case where the dimension K of β is much higher than the dimension of y. We propose some flexible Bayesian models which can yield sparse estimates of β. We show that as K → ∞ these models are closely related to a class of Lévy processes. Simulations demonstrate that our models outperform significantly a range of popular alternatives.},

  Abstract                 = {How do political actors learn about their environment when the "data" provided by political processes are characterized by rare events and highly discontinuous variation? In such learning environments, what can theory predict about how learning actors will take costly actions that are difficult to reverse (e.g., eliminating programs, approving a risky new product, revising a security policy, firing or recalling an appointed or elected official)? We develop a formal model for this problem and apply it to the termination of bureaucratic agencies. The conventional wisdom that "the older a bureau is, the less likely it is to die" (Downs 1967, Inside Bureaucracy) persists but has never been properly tested. This paper offers a learning-based stochastic optimization model of agency termination that offers two counterintuitive predictions. First, politicians terminate agencies only after learning about them, so the hazard of agencies should be nonmonotonic, contradicting Downs's prediction. Second, if terminating agencies is costly, agencies are least likely to be terminated when politicians are fiscally constrained or when the deficit is high. We assess the model by developing a battery of tests for the shape of the hazard function and estimate these and other duration models using data on U.S. federal government agencies created between 1946 and 1997. Results show that the hazard rate of agency termination is strongly nonmonotonic and that agencies are less likely to be terminated under high deficits and divided government. For the first 50 years of the agency duration distribution, the modal termination hazard occurs at five years after agencies are enabled. Methodologically, our approach ties the functional form of a hazard model tightly to theory and presents an applied "agenda" for testing the shape of an empirical hazard function. With extensions, our model and empirical framework are applicable to a range of political phenomena.},

Although the PSQI has been used in a variety of populations, published psychometric data are limited. The goal of this study was to examine psychometric properties of the PSQI among four populations: bone marrow transplant patients (n=155); renal transplant patients (n=56); women with breast cancer (n=102); and women with benign breast problems (n=159). Results supported PSQI internal consistency reliability and construct validity. Cronbach's alphas were 0.80 across groups and correlations between global and component scores were moderate to high. PSQI scores were moderately to highly correlated with measures of sleep quality and sleep problems, and poorly correlated with unrelated constructs. Individuals with sleep problems, poor sleep quality, and sleep restlessness had significantly higher PSQI scores in comparison to individuals without such problems.},

In particular, the explanatory power of the bargaining model is limited by two interrelated oversights about the nature of international relations and military power. First, the model assumes that an agreement reached is ipso facto an agreement enforcedâin other words, that the international system is not anarchic after all. Second, bargaining theories neglect that the role of military force is to change the distribution of benefits relative to the status quo. A deal made on the basis of what each state could win by fighting is unstable as soon as it is enacted, because the new allocation changes what each state could gain from war.},

  Abstract                 = {This study examines the effect of changes in domestic sources of leader support and domestic political institutions on patterns of UN voting. We argue that foreign policy change is most likely when a new leader comes to power who relies on a different core set of societal interests for support than her predecessor. We also argue that the extent to which foreign policy behavior changes with the domestic interests with access to power depends on domestic political institutions; democratic political institutions should increase foreign policy consistency, even in areas of foreign policy that are considered to be primarily expressive. We test our hypotheses using a new measure of UN voting patterns and new data on changes in leadersâ domestic supporting coalitions. In the preliminary analysis presented here (which covers the years 1985- 2008), we find that democracies do experience less change over time in UN voting patterns than non-democracies, but changes in a democratic leaderâs base of societal support does lead to increased change in UN voting. Non-democracies exhibit more change in UN voting overall, and in our preliminary analysis, we do not find evidence of linkage to change in a leaderâs base of domestic support within non-democracies.},

We develop a principal-agent model of party discipline and legislative voting under âopen listâ PR, where MPs may appeal to both their leaders (who control candidate lists) and voters (whose votes determine which candidates win seats). The model highlights the mediating influence of party organizations in the form of political leaders ability to enforce discipline, in conjunction with votersâ monitoring of individual legislatorâs voting behavior. First, resulting loyalty depends on how preferences diverge from the leadership: both MPs who align more toward their votersâ preferences and those who align more with the policies of other parties. We show that it is âcheaperâ for leaders to extract compliance for the first type of MP. Second, for both types, variation in compliance depends on partiesâ costs and resources for enforcing discipline. The model provides empirical implications which can be used to explain differences in voting unity across parties, individuals and time. We use data from Polandâs parliament during a period of substantial party change to provide some preliminary tests of these implications.},

  Abstract                 = {SUMMARY We show how to use the Gibbs sampler to carry out Bayesian inference on a linear state space model with errors that are a mixture of normals and coefficients that can switch over time. Our approach simultaneously generates the whole of the state vector given the mixture and coefficient indicator variables and simultaneously generates all the indicator variables conditional on the state vectors. The states are generated efficiently using the Kalman filter. We illustrate our approach by several examples and empirically compare its performance to another Gibbs sampler where the states are generated one at a time. The empirical results suggest that our approach is both practical to implement and dominates the Gibbs sampler that generates the states one at a time.},

State support for terrorist groups is commonly thought to be a factor that makes the pursuit of enemy groups much more difficult. I demonstrate with newly collected data that while state sponsorship is generally helpful to groups, this is not always the case. In particular, when sponsors provide a groupâs only safe haven dependence leads to increased chances of group failure. With a competing risks model, I distinguish between the cases in which a group internally dissolves and those in which the target forcefully eliminates the group and find that dependency makes forceful elimination significantly more likely.},

New international borders, we find, are drawn not according to principles of ânationalismâ or military strategy, but rather according to previous administrative frontiers.

We show that there are potential problems with each of these approaches, especially in the case of time dummies. We propose a simpler alternative: using t, t2 , and t3 to approxi- mate the hazard. This cubic polynomial is trivial to implement and avoids problems with time dummies such as quasi-complete separation and issues with splines such as interpretation or knot selection. It also accommodates non-proportional hazards in a much simpler way than either time dummies or splines. We show via monte carlo analysis that our method performs as well as splines and better than time dummies. We also demonstrate this method with reanalyses of a number of empirical studies such as Oneal and Russett (1997) and Crowley and Skocpol (2001).},

Since 1985, U.S. law has stipulated that the State Department iden- tify important votes and that USAID take the voting behavior of recipients in the UNGA into account in their disbursement decisions. We examine whether and how the United States's explicit policy of linking aid to important votes in the UNGA induces an element of strategy to aid recipients' voting decision. We find that the strategic use of aid disbursements indeed induces strategic voting and that both U.S. and recipient behavior changes significantly as a function of recipient regime type (i.e., left-right orientation and democracy) as well as factors such as whether the recipient is a U.S. ally. The presence of strategic behavior implies that the use of UNGA voting records to create measures of sincere "preferences" may be quite problematic unless the induced strategic element is properly accounted for.},

We describe the estimator’s advantages over existing approaches, including its robustness, adaptivity to different sparsity patterns and analytical tractability. We prove two theorems: one that characterizes the horseshoe estimator’s tail robustness and the other that demonstrates a super-efficient rate of convergence to the correct estimate of the sampling density in sparse situations. Finally, using both real and simulated data, we show that the horseshoe estimator corresponds quite closely to the answers obtained by Bayesian model averaging under a point-mass mixture prior.},

The advantages of the horseshoe are its robustness at handling unknown sparsity and large outlying signals. These properties are justifed theoretically via a representation theorem and accompanied by comprehensive empirical experiments that compare its performance to benchmark alternatives.},

Transaction data from a large commercial virtual world -- the first such data set provided to outside researchers -- is used to calculate metrics for production, consumption and money supply based on real-world definitions. Movements in these metrics over time were examined for consistency with common theories of macroeconomic change. The results indicated that virtual economic behavior follows real-world patterns. Moreover, a natural experiment occurred, in that a new version of the virtual world with the same rules came online during the study. The new world's macroeconomic aggregates quickly grew to be nearly exact replicas of those of the existing worlds, suggesting that `Code is Law': macroeconomic outcomes in a virtual world may be explained largely by design structure.},

This is a regularity in search of a theory. Drawing on the principles of self-organized criticality, I propose an agent-based model of war and state formation that exhibits power-law regularities. The computational findings suggest that the scale-free behavior depends on a process of technological change that leads to contextually dependent, stochastic decisions to wage war.Early drafts of this paper were prepared for presentation at the University of Michigan, the University of Chicago, Ohio State University, Yale University, the University of Pennsylvania, and Cornell University.

In a second step, we present an agent-based model that features states with a varying number of organizational levels. This model explicitly represents causal mechanisms of conquest and internal state-building through organizational bypass processes. The computational findings confirm our hypothesis that technological change is sufficient to trigger the emergence of modern, direct-state hierarchies. Our theoretical findings indicate that the historical transformation from indirect to direct rule presupposes a logistical, rather than the commonly assumed exponential, form of the loss-of-strength gradient.},

  Abstract                 = {There have been more than 200 wars since the start of the 20th century, leading to about 35 million battle deaths. However, efforts at forecasting conflicts have so far performed poorly for lack of fine-grained and comprehensive measures of geopolitical tensions. In this article, a weekly risk index is derived by analyzing a comprehensive dataset of historical newspaper articles over the past century. News reports have the advantage of conveying information about contemporaries’ interpretation of events and not having to rely on meaning inferred a posteriori with the benefit of hindsight. I applied this new index to a dataset of all wars within and between countries recorded since 1900, and found that the number of conflict-related news items increases dramatically prior to the onset of conflict. Using only information available at the time, the onset of a war within the next few months could be predicted with up to 85% confidence and predictions significantly improved upon existing methods both in terms of binary predictions (as measured by the area under the curve) and calibration (measured by the Brier score). Predictions also extend well before the onset of war – more than one year prior to interstate wars, and six months prior to civil wars – giving policymakers significant additional warning time.},

A conceptually transparent derivation of the posterior distribution of the states is discussed, which also leads to an efficient simulation algorithm that is modular, scalable and widely applicable. We also discuss a simple approach for evaluating the integrated likelihood, defined as the density of the data given the parameters but marginal of the state vector. We show that this high-dimensional integral can be easily evaluated with minimal computational and conceptual difficulty. Two empirical applications in macroeconomics demonstrate that the methods are versatile and computationally undemanding. In one application, involving a time-varying parameter model, we show that the methods allow for efficient handling of large state vectors. In our second application, involving a dynamic factor model, we introduce a new blocking strategy which results in improved MCMC mixing at little cost. The results demonstrate that the framework is simple, flexible and efficient.},

  Abstract                 = { Consider a structural break autoregressive (SBAR) process where j = 1, â¦, m + 1, {t1, â¦, tm} are change-points, 1 = t0 < t1 < âââ < tm + 1 = n + 1, Ï( Â· ) is a measurable function on , and {Ïµt} are white noise with unit variance. In practice, the number of change-points m is usually assumed to be known and small, because a large m would involve a huge amount of computational burden for parameters estimation. By reformulating the problem in a variable selection context, the group least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) is proposed to estimate an SBAR model when m is unknown. It is shown that both m and the locations of the change-points {t1, â¦, tm} can be consistently estimated from the data, and the computation can be efficiently performed. An improved practical version that incorporates group LASSO and the stepwise regression variable selection technique are discussed. Simulation studies are conducted to assess the finite sample performance. Supplementary materials for this article are available online. },

  Abstract                 = {In common law jurisdictions such as the United States, courts frequently resolve disputes by citation and analysis of reports of prior legal cases. The law may thus be thought of as a giant network containing textual information embedded in cases (nodes) and relationship information called citations (arcs) going from node to node. In recent years, the science of studying networks has developed and, while there had been some rudimentary attempts to look at subsets of the vast legal network, until recently there had been little done to take advantage of modern technology and modern network theory in that effort. This is a somewhat technical article written for a Mathematica conference that borrows techniques developed largely in sociology and physics to learn about Supreme Court jurisprudence simply by a study of its network structure. It is very much complementary to the work of Professor Thomas A. Smith of the University of San Diego Law School on "The Web of Law." Although the first half of the paper focuses on tool building and computer science issues in a way that may put off more law-oriented readers, the second half of the article relates quite directly to the law. It shows that federal jurisdiction and commerce clause cases are, quite literally, central to Supreme Court jurisprudence. It argues that the degree distribution of the Supreme Court network does not quite fit that of a scale free network but rather fits more closely that of a Weibull distribution, which is generated by the lifetime of objects. It suggests that rights of free speech and association may lie at the "core" of Supreme Court jurisprudence and thus pose issues of particular complexity. It is my hope that this article, along with other recent work, will catalyze a set of studies in this field that will expand to cover other judicial systems and yet more sophisticated analysis of the rich network information they contain.},

The hypothesis, running against the conventional view that suggests an anticorruption effect of electoral uncertainty, receives substantial empirical support by individual-level data from pre-1994 Italy. },

Second, who influences the process - the President alone or both the President and the Senate? Third, what explains the structure of the Federal Reserve appointment process? The test models show that the President alone, both the President and Senate, or neither, may influence monetary policy with Federal Reserve appointments. The structure of the process reflects political battles between the Democrats and Republicans regarding the centralization of authority to set monetary policy within the Federal Reserve System. The study extends the analysis to the European Central Bank and shows that the Federal Reserve process is more representative of society than the European Central Bank process.},

By installing their representatives in an institution, politicians can count on policy influence for the duration of their appointees' terms. Given the stakes, the occasional controversy regarding nominees is understandable. On the whole, however, nominations are not controversial; in fact, Senate confirmation votes are often unanimous. Nevertheless, the Senate can have substantial influence in the appointment process. Using a formal model, this article examines how the president and Senate strategically bargain with one another within the confines of the Federal Reserve appointment process to influence monetary policy. With a new way to estimate monetary policy preferences, this article shows empirically that policy influence occurs via appointments.},

Our central estimate suggests that Iraq collected \$1.3 billion in bribes from underpricing its oil, or 2 percent of oil revenues. Underpricing is higher during periods of high volatility in oil marketsâwhen detection is more difficultâbut declines after the UN limited Iraq's ability to set the price of its oil.},

  Abstrct                  = { How do international financial instituitons interact with international markets? In particular, how to markets react to major multilateral lending initiatives. We analyze a formal model that demonstrates that the âcatalytic effectâ of the IMF, or the ef- fect of IMF program announcements on international investment flows, is conditional. Namely, the degree to which IMF programs stimulate investment flows depends on how market actors interpret the motivations behind a lending decision of the IMF. If investors believe the IMF endorsement of a program as a sign of economic weak- ness of a country, then they do not invest following the IMF decision. On the other hand, if the market actors interpret an IMF endorsement as a sign of major donorsâ interest in the applicant country, then they may respond with private investment, cre- ating the âcatalytic effect.â In other words, informal influence driving IMF decisions can have differing implications for the likelihood of future certainty in the investment environment. Our theory helps explain discrepant empirical findings with respect to the catalytic effect of IMF programs, and we test additional empirical implications by examining how sovereign credit ratings are affected by program announcements, loan size, and scope of conditions attached to loans. },

  Abstract                 = {In many countries, monetary policy decisions are made by committees. In the United States, these decisions are made by the Federal Reserve's Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC), which consists of the seven members of the Board of Governors and the presidents of the twelve district banks. This book examines the process by which the preferences of the FOMC's individual members are translated into collective policy choices. This focus on the aggregation of individual preferences into group decisions is unique and provides an important perspective on the evolution of monetary policy choices. To study decision making by the FOMC, the authors have used both formal voting records and detailed transcripts and summaries of deliberations contained in the committee's Memoranda of Discussion and FOMC Transcripts. The latter sources have been used to construct data sets describing individual committee members' policy preferences for the 1970-1978 and 1987-1996 periods when the FOMC was chaired by Arthur Burns and Alan Greenspan, respectively. These data are used to estimate monetary policy reaction functions for individual Committee members and to explore the role of majoritarian pressures, pressures for consensus, and the power of the chairman in collective decision making. The rich anecdotal evidence found in the Memoranda of Discussion and FOMC Transcripts inspires the narrative approach taken in two chapters, on the influence of political pressure on FOMC deliberations and on the relevance of the time inconsistency problem for the rise of inflation in the 1970s.},

  Abstract                 = {INTRODUCTION: The Functional Outcomes of Sleep Questionnaire (FOSQ), has been used in research and clinical practice to measure the impact of daytime sleepiness on activities of daily living. The purpose of this study was to develop a shorter version of the instrument (FOSQ-10) that may be more easily implemented in clinical practice. METHODS: Data from a study of CPAP-treated obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) patients (Sample 1) (n = 155, AHI = 63 +/- 31) were used to develop the FOSQ-10. Of the 30 original FOSQ items, 10 questions representing each of the 5 subscales were selected if they had a normal distribution of responses and the largest pre- to post-treatment effect size. The psychometric properties of the instrument were then evaluated with data from a second, independent sample of CPAP-treated OSA patients (n = 51 AH I = 51 +/- 28). RESULTS: Internal consistency of the FOSQ-10 was alpha = 0.87. Pre-treatment correlations of the 2 scales was r = 0.96. After 3 months of treatment the correlation was r = 0.97 (P < 0.0001). Subscales were also highly correlated at baseline and following treatment. Effect sizes for both instruments were highly correlated and indicated ability to measure meaningful change. Differences were observed between scores on the FOSQ-10 for normal controls and OSA patients. CONCLUSIONS: The FOSQ-10 is a psychometrically strong instrument that performs similarly to the long version. The rapidly completed and easily scored FOSQ-10 shows promise for application in the clinical setting.},

  Abstract                 = {In content-driven reputation systems for collaborative content, users gain or lose reputation according to how their contributions fare: authors of long-lived contributions gain reputation, while authors of reverted contributions lose reputation. Existing content-driven systems are prone to Sybil attacks, in which multiple identities, controlled by the same person, perform coordinated actions to increase their reputation. We show that content-driven reputation systems can be made resistent to such attacks by taking advantage of the fact that the reputation increments and decrements depend on content modifications, which are visible to all. We present an algorithm for content-driven reputation that prevents a set of identities from increasing their maximum reputation without doing any useful work. Here, work is considered useful if it causes content to evolve in a direction that is consistent with the actions of high-reputation users. We argue that the content modifications that require no effort, such as the insertion or deletion of arbitrary text, are invariably non-useful. We prove a truthfullness result for the resulting system, stating that users who wish to perform a contribution do not gain by employing complex contribution schemes, compared to simply performing the contribution at once. In particular, splitting the contribution in multiple portions, or employing the coordinated actions of multiple identities, do not yield additional reputation. Taken together, these results indicate that content-driven systems can be made robust with respect to Sybil attacks.},

We argue that differences across regime measures must be taken seriously and that they should be evaluated in terms of whether they (1) serve to address important research questions, (2) can be interpreted meaningfully, and (3) are reproducible. We argue that existing measures of democracy are not interchangeable and that the choice of measure should be guided by its theoretical and empirical underpinnings. We show that the choice of regime measure matters by replicating studies published in leading journals.},

U.S. capital markets are more resilient than in the past and recover sooner from terrorist attacks than other global capital markets. Evidence suggests that this increased market resilience can be partially explained by a stable banking/financial sector that provides adequate liquidity to promote market stability and minimize panic.},

  Abstract                 = { This paper provides a new Bayesian approach for models with multiple change points. The centerpiece of the approach is a formulation of the change-point model in terms of a latent discrete state variable that indicates the regime from which a particular observation has been drawn. This state variable is specified to evolve according to a discrete-time discrete-state Markov process with the transition probabilities constrained so that the state variable can either stay at the current value or jump to the next higher value. This parameterization exactly reproduces the change point model. The model is estimated by Markov chain Monte Carlo methods using an approach that is based on Chib (1996). This methodology is quite valuable since it allows for the fitting of more complex change point models than was possible before. Methods for the computation of Bayes factors are also developed. All the techniques are illustrated using simulated and real data sets.},

  Abstract                 = { This paper is concerned with finite mixture models in which the populations from one observation to the next are selected according to an unobserved Markov process. A new, full Bayesian approach based on the method of Gibbs sampling is developed. Calculations are simplified by data augmentation, achieved by introducing a population index variable into the list of unknown parameters. It is shown that the latent variables, one for each observation, can be simulated from their joint distribution given the data and the remaining parameters. This result serves to accelerate the convergence of the Gibbs sample. Modal estimates are also computed by stochastic versions of the EM algorithm. These provide an alternative to a full Bayesian approach and to existing methods of locating the maximum likelihood estimate. The ideas are applied in detail to Poisson data, mixtures of multivariate normal distributions, and autoregressive time series.},

The procedures can be applied to pure ARMA time series models and to determine features of the likelihood function by choosing appropriate diffuse priors. Our results are unconditional on the initial observations. We also show how the algorithm can be further simplified for the important special cases of stationary AR(p) and invertible MA(q) models.

  Abstract                 = {This paper is concerned with the Bayesian estimation and comparison of flexible, high dimensional multivariate time series models with time varying correlations. The model proposed and considered here combines features of the classical factor model with that of the heavy tailed univariate stochastic volatility model. A unified analysis of the model, and its special cases, is developed that encompasses estimation, filtering and model choice. The centerpieces of the estimation algorithm (which relies on \{MCMC\} methods) are: (1) a reduced blocking scheme for sampling the free elements of the loading matrix and the factors and (2) a special method for sampling the parameters of the univariate \{SV\} process. The resulting algorithm is scalable in terms of series and factors and simulation-efficient. Methods for estimating the log-likelihood function and the filtered values of the time-varying volatilities and correlations are also provided. The performance and effectiveness of the inferential methods are extensively tested using simulated data where models up to 50 dimensions and 688 parameters are fit and studied. The performance of our model, in relation to various multivariate \{GARCH\} models, is also evaluated using a real data set of weekly returns on a set of 10 international stock indices. We consider the performance along two dimensions: the ability to correctly estimate the conditional covariance matrix of future returns and the unconditional and conditional coverage of the 5\% and 1\% value-at-risk (VaR) measures of four pre-defined portfolios.},

  Abstract                 = {We create a new index that measures the extent of openness in capital account transactions. Despite the abundance of literature and policy analyses regarding the effect of financial liberalization, the debate is far from settled. One of the reasons for that outcome is the lack of proper ways of measuring the extent of the openness in cross-border financial transactions. We seek to remedy this deficiency by creating an index aimed at measuring the extensity of capital controls based on the information from the IMFÃ¢â¬â¢s Annual Report on Exchange Arrangements and Exchange Restrictions (AREAER). This paper details how we construct the data and where our index stands in relation to the extant literature. Given the intricacy of capital controls policies and regulations, the exercise of quantifying the extent of financial openness remains a challenging task. Nonetheless, our index makes a substantial contribution in terms of its coverage of countries and time period; the data are available for 181 countries for the 1970 Ã¢â¬â 2005 period.},

  Abstract                 = {Recent work in comparative politics and international relations has shown a marked shift toward leaders as the theoretical unit of analysis. In most of the new theoretical models a core assumption is that leaders act to stay in power. There exists, however, remarkably little systematic empirical knowledge about the factors that affect the tenure of leaders. To provide a baseline of empirical results we explore how a broad range of domestic and international factors affects the tenure of leaders. We focus in particular on the effect of conflict and its outcome. We find that political institutions fundamentally mediate the costs and benefits of international conflict and that war is not necessarilyex postinefficient for leaders. This suggests that the assumption that war isex postinefficient for unitary rational actors can not be simply extended to leaders. Therefore, a focus on leaders may yield important new rationalist explanations for war.},

  Abstract                 = {The literature on diversionary war has long argued that a leader's tenure considerations play an important role in international conflict behavior. However, for the diversionary use of force to be rational, international conflict must in turn affect the leader's tenure. A two-stage probit model on a new data set of all leaders between 1919 and 1992 is used to examine this reciprocal relationship between the probability of losing office and the probability of crisis initiation. Contrary to theories of the diversionary use of force, results show that an increase in the risk of losing office makes leaders less likely to initiate a crisis, and an increase in the risk of an international crisis makes leaders more likely to lose office. Results also suggest that democracies are overall less likely to initiate a crisis because of the domestic political insecurity of democratic leaders.},

For example, all markets are characterized by agents connected by complex, multilateral information networks, and the network structure influences economic outcomes. In an earlier study, we undertook an experimental investigation of learning in various three-person networks, each of which gives rise to its own learning patterns. In the laboratory, learning in networks is challenging and the difficulty of solving the decision problem is sometimes massive even in the case of three persons. We found that the theory can account surprisingly well for the behavior observed in the laboratory. The aim of the present paper is to investigate important and interesting questions about individual and group behavior, including comparisons across networks and information treatments. We find that in order to explain subjects' behavior, it is necessary to take into account the details of the network architecture as well as the information structure. We also identify some "black spots" where the theory does least well in interpreting the data.},

Our empirical identification exploits the fact that such insurance was first made available to wives of government employees, before being made universally available in Taiwan in 1995.We find that the availability of insurance for non-workers was associated with a 4 percentage point decline in labor force participation among marriedwomen, with larger declines amongwomen from lowincome households. Countries considering universal health insurance as in Taiwan should anticipate similar declines in labor force participation. ÃâÃÂ© 2001 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.},

The empirical study employs daily Dow Jones industrial average stock index and volatility from January 1939 to December 1945 and applies structural shift oriented test to determine endogenously the structural breaks during the WWII period. Results show that the majority of the wartime events (on and off the battlefield) labelled important by historians did result in structural breaks in both price movement and stock returns volatility (risk).

  Abstract                 = {Large scale simulations of the movements of people in a ??????virtual?????? city and their analyses are used to generate insights into understanding the dynamic processes that depend on the interactions between people. Models, based on these interactions, can be used in optimizing traffic flow, slowing the spread of infectious diseases, or predicting the change in cell phone usage in a disaster. We analyzed cumulative and aggregated data generated from the simulated movements of 1.63106 individuals in a computer ~pseudo-agent-based! model during a typical day in Portland, Oregon. This city is mapped into a graph with 181 206 nodes representing physical locations such as buildings. Connecting edges model individual???s flow between nodes. Edge weights are constructed from the daily traffic of individuals moving between locations. The number of edges leaving a node out-degree!, the edge weights ~out-traffic!, and the edge weights per location ~total out-traffic! are fitted well by power-law distributions. The power-law distributions also fit subgraphs based on work, school, and social/recreational activities. The resulting weighted graph is a ??????small world?????? and has scaling laws consistent with an underlying hierarchical structure. We also explore the time evolution of the largest connected component and the distribution of the component sizes. We observe a strong linear correlation between the out-degree and total out-traffic distributions and significant levels of clustering. We discuss how these network features can be used to characterize social networks and their relationship to dynamic processes.},

Moreover if np / log n = c > 8, then the diameter of G(n,p) is concentrated on two values. In general, if np / log n = c > c0, the diameter is concentrated on at most 2\lfloor 1 / c0 \rfloor + 4 values. We also proved that the diameter of G(n,p) is almost surely equal to the diameter of its giant component if np > 3.6.},

This simple and robust result has implications in a wide variety of contexts, including individual choice under uncertainty, strategic form games, and incom- plete information games.

A communication network helps coordination in exactly two ways: by informing each stage about earlier stages, and by creating common knowledge within each stage. We then consider two examples: first we show that"low dimensional" networks can be better for coordination eventhough they have far fewer links than "high dimensional" networks;second we show that wide dispersion of "insurgents", peoplepredisposed toward participation, can be good for coordination but too muchdispersion can be bad.},

  Abstract                 = {A significant limitation in the empirical analysis of judicial politics has been the difficulty of measuring judicial policy. Theories of bargaining and opinion writing make predictions about where an opinion will fall in policy space, but empirical tests of those theories have not benefited from direct measures of opinion location. This paper develops a scaling model to estimate opin- ion locations and justice ideal points along a common, continuous dimension using the citations between opinions as data. We assume that each opinion has a fixed location in this unidimen- sional doctrine space and that the probability of a citation that affirms rather than disputes the doctrine of the precedent decreases as the doctrinal distance between them increases. This prox- imity citation model is applied to original datasets of citations in search and seizure and freedom of religion opinions written by the Warren, Burger and Rehnquist Courts. We use the resulting estimates of opinion content to evaluate median and non-median voter theories of Supreme Court bargaining and opinion writing. We find striking empirical support for theoretical models that predict the majority opinion will fall at the ideal point of the median member of the majority coalition as opposed to the courtâs median or the opinion authorâs ideal point. Given the central- ity of theories of judicial policymaking to various substantive problems in political science, the method of scaling opinions developed in this paper can facilitate a variety of future research.},

  Abstract                 = {The literature on global integration and national policy autonomy often ignores a central result from open economy macroeconomics: Capital mobility constrains monetary policy when the exchange rate is fixed and fiscal policy when the exchange rate is flexible. Similarly, examinations of the electoral determinants of monetary and fiscal policy typically ignore international pressures altogether. We develop a formal model to analyze the interaction between fiscal and monetary policymakers under various exchange rate regimes and the degrees of central bank independence. We test the model using data from OECD countries. We find evidence that preelectoral monetary expansions occur only when the exchange rate is flexible and central bank independence is low; preelectoral fiscal expansions occur when the exchange rate is fixed. We then explore the implications of our model for arguments that emphasize the partisan sources of macroeconomic policy and for the conduct of fiscal policy after economic and monetary union in Europe.},

Therefore, the relative entropy rate Dn/n converges to zero at rate (log n)/n. The constant c, which the authors explicitly identify, depends only on the prior density function and the Fisher information matrix evaluated at the true parameter value.

  Abstract                 = {The aim of this article is to demonstrate that comparative theory testing is necessary if political scientists wish to make positive statements regarding the confirmation of their theories. Using the tools of formal logic, the author first establishes that theory confirmation is not possible when a theory is tested in isolation, regardless of the statistical approach--falsificationism, confirmationism, or Bayesian confirmationism--employed by the researcher. The author then establishes a necessary and sufficient condition for positive theory confirmation and shows that this condition is met only when two rival theories are tested against one another. Finally, the author discusses two methods of comparative theory testing demonstrating that being comparative, besides being necessary, is also straightforward and practical.},

  Abstract                 = {This paper considers a simple distribution-free test for nonnested model selection. The new test is shown to be asymptotically more efficient than the well-known Vuong test when the distribution of individual log-likelihood ratios is highly peaked. Monte Carlo results demonstrate that for many applied research situations, this distribution is indeed highly peaked. The simulation further demonstrates that the proposed test has greater power than the Vuong test under these conditions. The substantive application addresses the effect of domestic political institutions on foreign policy decision making. Do domestic institutions have effects because they hold political leaders accountable, or do they simply promote political norms that shape elite bargaining behavior? The results indicate that the latter model has greater explanatory power.},

The argument is intuitively appealing and supported by extensive data analysis. Unfortunately, the statistical technique they use induces omitted variable bias into their results. They argue that they need to control for democracy, but their estimation procedure is equivalent to omitting democracy from their analysis.

  Abstract                 = {Power-law distributions occur in many situations of scientific interest and have significant consequences for our understanding of natural and man-made phenomena. Unfortunately, the detection and characterization of power laws is complicated by the large fluctuations that occur in the tail of the distributionâthe part of the distribution representing large but rare eventsâ and by the difficulty of identifying the range over which power-law behavior holds. Commonly used methods for analyzing power-law data, such as least-squares fitting, can produce substantially inaccurate estimates of parameters for power-law distributions, and even in cases where such methods return accurate answers they are still unsatisfactory because they give no indication of whether the data obey a power law at all. Here we present a principled statistical framework for discerning and quantifying power-law behavior in empirical data. Our approach combines maximum-likelihood fitting methods with goodness-of-fit tests based on the Kolmogorov-Smirnov statistic and likelihood ratios. We evaluate the effectiveness of the approach with tests on synthetic data and give critical comparisons to previous approaches. We also apply the proposed methods to twenty-four real-world data sets from a range of different disciplines, each of which has been conjectured to follow a power- law distribution. In some cases we find these conjectures to be consistent with the data while in others the power law is ruled out.},

Using the tools of extremal statistics to analyze the set of terrorist attacks worldwide between 1968 and 2004, as compiled by the National Memorial Institute for the Prevention of Terrorism (MIPT), we find that the relationship between the frequency and severity of terrorist attacks exhibits the ``scale-free'' property with an exponent of close to two. This property is robust, even when we restrict our analysis to events from a single type of weapon or events within major industrialized nations. We also find that the distribution of event sizes has changed very little over the past 37 years, suggesting that scale invariance is an inherent feature of global terrorism.},

We show that these events are uniformly characterized by the phenomenon of "scale invariance," that is, the frequency scales as an inverse power of the severity, P(x) Ax-{alpha}. We find that this property is a robust feature of terrorism, persisting when we control for economic development of the target country, the type of weapon used, and even for short time scales. Further, we show that the center of the distribution oscillates slightly with a period of roughly {tau}{approx} 13 years, that there exist significant temporal correlations in the frequency of severe events, and that current models of event incidence cannot account for these variations or the scale invariance property of global terrorism. Finally, we describe a simple toy model for the generation of these statistics and briefly discuss its implications.},

  Abstract                 = {We develop a Bayesian procedure for estimation and inference for spatial models of roll call voting. This approach is extremely flexible, applicable to any legislative setting, irrespective of size, the extremism of the legislators' voting histories, or the number of roll calls available for analysis. The model is easily extended to let other sources of information inform the analysis of roll call data, such as the number and nature of the underlying dimensions, the presence of party whipping, the determinants of legislator preferences, and the evolution of the legislative agenda; this is especially helpful since generally it is inappropriate to use estimates of extant methods (usually generated under assumptions of sincere voting) to test models embodying alternate assumptions (e.g., log-rolling, party discipline). A Bayesian approach also provides a coherent framework for estimation and inference with roll call data that eludes extant methods; moreover, via Bayesian simulation methods, it is straightforward to generate uncertainty assessments or hypothesis tests concerning any auxiliary quantity of interest or to formally compare models. In a series of examples we show how our method is easily extended to accommodate theoretically interesting models of legislative behavior. Our goal is to provide a statistical framework for combining the measurement of legislative preferences with tests of models of legislative behavior.},

The principal problem in testing lawmaking theories is that many analysts use roll-call votes2014or various measures based on roll-call votes2014when, in fact, these votes are partly a cause and partly a consequence of the very things the theories seek to explain. This can lead to erroneous substantive conclusions and characterizations. I show how embedding the theoretical predictions of the party gatekeeping and veto pivot theories of lawmaking within a statistical model used to estimate ideal points yields a straightforward test; if the gridlock interval measured using votes on policies predicted by the theories is nonzero, the predictions of the theory are not supported by the observed data and assumed behavioral voting model. Implementing the test reveals little support for either theory.},

Studying this aspect of American politics is difficult because theories of agency behavior, effectiveness, and control often require mea- sures of administrative agenciesÃ¢â¬â¢ policy preferences, and appropriate measures are hard to find for a broad spectrum of agencies. We propose a method for measuring agency pref- erences based upon an expert survey of agency preferences for 82 executive agencies in existence between 1988 and 2005. We use a multirater item response model to provide a principled structure for combining subjective ratings based on scholarly and journalistic expertise with objective data on agency characteristics. We compare the resulting agency preference estimates and standard errors to existing alternative measures, discussing both the advantages and limitations of the method. mv},

  Abstract                 = {A difficult yet prevalent problem in legislative politics is how to assess explanations when observable actions may not represent true (and unobserved) legislator preferences. We present a method for analyzing the validity of theoretical/historical accounts that unifies theory, history, and measurement. We argue that approaches to testing accounts of legislative behavior which are theoretically and historically agnostic are not always best and present an approach which: (1) forms an explicit explanation of behavior (here a simple dynamic voting game) that yields estimable parameter constraints, and (2) tests these constraints using a customized empirical model that is as consistent as possible with the explanation. We demonstrate the method using legislative voting data from the first Congress (1789-1791). Using the idea of sophisticated equivalents from voting theory we subject the traditional account of the "Compromise of 1790" to a statistical test and find that there is reason to doubt the claim that legislators of the time believed the specified log roll was taking place. The results suggest that the capital location and assumption issues were resolved independently.},

  Abstract                 = {Scholars of legislative studies typically use ideal point estimates from scaling procedures to test theories of legislative politics. We contend that theory and methods may be better integrated by directly incorporating maintained and to be tested hypotheses in the statistical model used to estimate legislator preferences. In this view of theory and estimation, formal modeling (1) provides auxiliary assumptions that serve as constraints in the estimation process, and (2) generates testable predictions. The estimation and hypothesis testing procedure uses roll call data to evaluate the validity of theoretically derived to be tested hypotheses in a world where maintained hypotheses are presumed true. We articulate the approach using the language of statistical inference (both frequentist and Bayesian). The approach is demonstrated in analyses of the well-studied Powell amendment to the federal aid-to-education bill in the 84th House and the Compromise of 1790 in the 1st House.},

  Abstract                 = {Existing preference estimation procedures do not incorporate the full structure of the spatial model of voting, as they fail to use the sequential nature of the agenda. In the maximum likelihood framework, the consequences of this omission may be far-reaching. First, information useful for the identification of the model is neglected. Specifically, information that identifies the proposal locations is ignored. Second, the dimensionality of the policy space may be incorrectly estimated. Third, preference and proposal location estimates are incorrect and difficult to interpret in terms of the spatial model. We also show that the Bayesian simulation approach to ideal point estimation (Clinton et al. 2000; Jackman 2000) may be improved through the use of information about the legislative agenda. This point is illustrated by comparing several preference estimators of the first U.S. House (1789-1791).},

While COW and PRIO provide data on total casualties for each combatant in interstate wars from 1816 to 2001, they do not provide data about who inflicted which casualties on whom, an important question when more than two combatant states are involved in a war. For wars involving more than two combatant states, the LERD uses secondary historical sources to calculate loss exchange ratios for battles for which there are casualties documented for each side, then aggregates those battle- level ratios to create war-level ratios for each pair of combatants. This paper then uses the LERD data to analyze the effect of regime type on military effectiveness to demonstrate the dataset’s potential to help answer important theoretical questions.}

Second, do experts and informed citizens rate presidents similarly, and do they rely on the same criteria in their ratings? I use a C-SPAN poll administered in 2000 to experts, and through the Internet to the citizenry, as the data to address these questions. Results find great temporal stability in how presidents are rated. Furthermore, in applying a predictive model developed by Simonton, I find stability in the factors that predict presidential greatness ratings. In particular, experts and informed citizens rate presidents similarly and use similar criteria. Substantively, the most important and consistent predictor of presidential greatness is the number of years that the president served in office. This finding brings us full circle to a question that motivates much scholarship on the presidency: why do presidents get reelected for a second term?},

  Abstract                 = {A common property of many large networks, including the Internet, is that the connectivity of the various nodes follows a scale-free power-law distribution, $P(k)=ck^-a$. We study the stability of such networks with respect to crashes, such as random removal of sites. Our approach, based on percolation theory, leads to a general condition for the critical fraction of nodes, $p_c$, that need to be removed before the network disintegrates. We show that for $a<=3$ the transition never takes place, unless the network is finite. In the special case of the Internet (a=2.5), we find that it is impressively robust, where $p_c$ is approximately 0.99.},

Once the correction is made, there are broader implications for testing theories of war using quantitative studies.

  Abstract                 = { âª Abstractâ Prominent scholars engaged in comparative research on democratic regimes are in sharp disagreement over the choice between a dichotomous or graded approach to the distinction between democracy and nondemocracy. This choice is substantively important because it affects the findings of empirical research. It is methodologically important because it raises basic issues, faced by both qualitative and quantitative analysts, concerning appropriate standards for justifying choices about concepts. In our view, generic claims that the concept of democracy should inherently be treated as dichotomous or graded are incomplete. The burden of demonstration should instead rest on more specific arguments linked to the goals of research. We thus take the pragmatic position that how scholars understand and operationalize a concept can and should depend in part on what they are going to do with it. We consider justifications focused on the conceptualization of democratization as an event, the conceptual requirements for analyzing subtypes of democracy, the empirical distribution of cases, normative evaluation, the idea of regimes as bounded wholes, and the goal of achieving sharper analytic differentiation. },

  Abstract                 = {We investigate the causes of civil war, using a new data set of wars during 1960â99. Rebellion may be explained by atypically severe grievances, such as high inequality, a lack of political rights, or ethnic and religious divisions in society. Alternatively, it might be explained by atypical opportunities for building a rebel organization. While it is difficult to find proxies for grievances and opportunities, we find that political and social variables that are most obviously related to grievances have little explanatory power. By contrast, economic variables, which could proxy some grievances but are perhaps more obviously related to the viability of rebellion, provide considerably more explanatory power.},

  Abstract                 = { The authors compare two contrasting motivations for rebellion: greed and grievance. Most rebellions are ostensibly in pursuit of a cause, supported by a narrative of grievance. But since grievance assuagement through rebellion is a public good that a government will not supply, economists predict such rebellions would be rare. Empirically, many rebellions appear to be linked to the capture of resources (such as diamonds in Angola, and Sierra Leone, drugs in Colombia, and timber in Cambodia). The authors set up a simple rational choice model of greed-rebellion, and contrasts its predictions with those of a simple grievance model. Some countries return to conflict repeatedly. Are they conflict-prone, or is there a feedback effect whereby conflict generates grievance, which in turn generates further conflict? The authors show why such a feedback effect might be present in both greed-motivated and grievance rebellions. The authors' results contrast with conventional beliefs, about the causes of conflict. A stylized version of conventional beliefs would be that grievance begets conflict, which begets grievance, which begets further conflict. With such a model, the only point at which to intervene is to reduce the level of objective grievance. The authors' model suggests that what actually happens is that opportunities for predation (controlling primary commodity exports) cause conflict, and the grievances this generates induce diasporas to finance further conflict. The point of policy intervention here is to reduce the absolute, and relative attraction of primary commodity predation, and to reduce the ability of diasporas to fund rebel movements.},

  Abstract                 = {This article explores empirically the duration of civil war. It relates the duration of civil war to two alternative models of conflict and culls testable hypotheses from the case study literature on civil war. Using a comprehensive dataset on large-scale violent civil conflicts covering the 1960-2000 period, a wide range of hypotheses are tested by means of hazard function regressions. The results show that the duration of conflict is systematically related both to structural conditions prevailing prior to conflict and to circumstances during conflict. The key structural characteristics that lengthen conflict are low per capita income, high inequality and a moderate degree of ethnic division. The key variable characteristics that shorten conflict are a decline in the prices of the primary commodities that the country exports and external military intervention on the side of the rebels. Furthermore, the results indicate that the chances of peace were much lower in the 1980s and 1990s than they had been previously. Three empirical explanations are suggested as different approaches to civil war: rebellion-as-investment, in which the critical incentive is the post-conflict payoff; rebellion-as-business, in which the critical incentive is the payoff during conflict; and rebellion-as-mistake, in which military optimism prevents the recognition of any mutually advantageous settlement. The article concludes that the empirical evidence is incompatible with the first of these approaches but consistent with the others.},

We first provide some background on the history of state space methods for the analysis of time series. This is followed by a concise overview of linear Gaussian state space analysis including the modelling framework and appropriate estimation methods. We discuss the important class of unobserved component models which incorporate a trend, a seasonal, a cycle, and fixed explanatory and intervention variables for the univariate and multivariate analysis of time series. We continue the discussion by presenting methods for the computation of different estimates for the unobserved state vector: filtering, prediction, and smoothing. Estimation approaches for the other parameters in the model are also considered. Next, we discuss how the estimation procedures can be used for constructing confidence intervals, detecting outlier observations and structural breaks, and testing model assumptions of residual independence, homoscedasticity, and normality. We then show how ARIMA and ARIMA components models fit in the state space framework to time series analysis. We also provide a basic introduction for non-Gaussian state space models. Finally, we present an overview of the software tools currently available for the analysis of time series with state space methods as they are discussed in the other contributions to this special volume.},

We ask two questions: whether governments are converging on common principles for governing shared river basins and whether the effort to create a global normative framework for shared rivers has shaped the principled content of basin-level international accords. The data reveal a complex process of normative development. A few core principles emanating from global legal efforts have shown significant growth, diffusion and deepening at the basin-specific level. Others are common in basin agreements but show no diffusion or deepening. Still others are weakly represented in the data. If joint articulation of common principles is necessary for regime formation, then there is only weak evidence for a global rivers regime. But the data also reveal normative developments not captured by a regime-theoretic lens: a backlash reinforcing sovereign rights, the emergence of two seemingly conflicting clusters of principles, and an ambiguous relationship between some principles typically thought to be mutually reinforcing. The results show the need to treat principled content as an important dependent variable in the study of cooperation and to view institution building as a dynamic, multi-dimensional and multi-level process.},

  Abstract                 = {One of the most important questions of human existence is what drives nations to war--especially massive, system-threatening war. Much military history focuses on the who, when, and where of war; in this riveting book, Dale C. Copeland brings attention to bear on why governments make decisions that lead to, sustain, and intensify conflicts. Copeland presents detailed historical narratives of several twentieth-century cases, including World War I, World War II, and the Cold War. He highlights instigating factors that transcend individual personalities, styles of government, geography, and historical context to reveal remarkable consistency across several major wars usually considered dissimilar. The result is a series of challenges to established interpretive positions and provocative new readings of the causes of conflict. Classical realists and neorealists claim that dominant powers initiate war. Hegemonic stability realists believe that wars are most often started by rising states. Copeland offers an approach stronger in explanatory power and predictive capacity than these three brands of realism: he examines not only the power resources but the shifting power differentials of states. He specifies more precisely the conditions under which state decline leads to conflict, drawing empirical support from the critical cases of the twentieth century as well as major wars spanning ancient Greece to the Napoleonic Wars.},

  Abstract                 = { This article argues that the institutional mandates of central banks have an important influence on inflation outcomes in the advanced industrialized countries. Central banks that are also responsible for bank regulation will be more sensitive to the profitability and stability of the banking sector and therefore less likely to alter interest rates solely on the basis of price stability objectives. When bank regulation is assigned to a separate agency, the central bank is more likely to enact tighter monetary policies geared solely toward maintaining price stability. An econometric analysis of inflation in 23 industrial countries from 1975 to 1999 reveals that inflation is significantly higher in those countries with central banks that are vested with bank regulatory responsibility, although this effect is conditional on the choice of exchange rate regime and the relative size of the banking sector. We also conduct a case study of the Bank of England, which lost its bank regulatory authority to a new agency in 1998. We find that the new Labour government under Tony Blair imposed the institutional change on the Bank of England in part to remove the bank stability bias from its monetary policymaking. These findings suggest that the mandates of central banks not only have important influences on macroeconomic outcomes, but may also be modified in the future by governments seeking to impose their own monetary policy preferences. },

These two dimensions were consistently fundamental to the most commonly used indicators of democracy from 1950 to 2000. Our analysis produces new indicators of contestations and inclusiveness for most countries from 1950 to 2000.},

  Abstract                 = {Why do states delegate certain tasks and responsibilities to international organizations rather than acting unilaterally or cooperating directly? Furthermore, to what extent do states continue to control IOs once authority has been delegated? Examining a variety of different institutions including the World Trade Organization, the United Nations and the European Commission, this book explores the different methods that states employ to ensure their interests are being served, and identifies the problems involved with monitoring and managing IOs. The contributors suggest that it is not inherently more difficult to design effective delegation mechanisms at international level than at domestic level and, drawing on principal-agent theory, help explain the variations that exist in the extent to which states are willing to delegate to IOs. They argue that IOs are neither all evil nor all virtuous, but are better understood as bureaucracies that can be controlled to varying degrees by their political masters.},

  Abstract                 = {It has long been recognized that information technology (IT) can facilitate (or even permit) forms of empirical analysis unimagined just a generation ago. However, political scientists have generally experimented with only a narrow range of the possibilities the new technologies offer - easier writing, editing and communications processes, and more sophisticated statistical analyses. While these have undoubtedly increased productivity and rigor within the discipline, other IT applications have largely gone unnoticed. The growing pool of Computer-Aided Qualitative Data Analysis Software (CAQDAS) technologies presents researchers with new ways to conceptualize, perceive, and communicate their research, with the potential of revolutionizing social science research. This paper offers an overview of those IT and CAQDAS solutions with the most potential to facilitate political inquiry, and offers a series of practical steps by which technological novices might begin to apply the new technologies in their research. In closing, we discuss the benefits and perils of using such technology, and suggest the ways by which IT might strengthen current research techniques. The appendix catalogues several dozen applications for data acquisition, organization, processing, analysis and presentation, with contact and pricing information.},

Some novels present verbal models of reality. I interpret other novels as a kind of simulation, akin to how simulations are used in economics. Economics can, and has, profited from the insights contained in novels. Nonetheless, while novels and models lie along a common spectrum, they differ in many particulars.

  Abstract                 = {A critical issue for users of Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods in applications is how to determine when it is safe to stop sampling and use the samples to estimate characteristics of the distribution of interest. Research into methods of computing theoretical convergence bounds holds promise for the future but to date has yielded relatively little of practical use in applied work. Consequently, most MCMC users address the convergence problem by applying diagnostic tools to the output produced by running their samplers. After giving a brief overview of the area, we provide an expository review of 13 convergence diagnostics, describing the theoretical basis and practical implementation of each. We then compare their performance in two simple models and conclude that all of the methods can fail to detect the sorts of convergence failure that they were designed to identify. We thus recommend a combination of strategies aimed at evaluating and accelerating MCMC sampler convergence, including applying diagnostic procedures to a small number of parallel chains, monitoring autocorrelations and cross-correlations, and modifying parametrizations or sampling algorithms appropriately. We emphasize, however, that it is not possible to say with certainty that a finite sample from an MCMC algorithm is representative of an underlying stationary distribution.},

We consider which items in the toolbox are the most appropriate for use in the legislative setting, then apply them to estimate levels of bias in the U.S. House from 1879 to 2000. Our results indicate a systematic bias in favor of the majority party over this period, with the strongest bias arising during the period of "czar rule" (51st201360th Congresses, 188920131910) and during the post-packing era (87th2013106th Congresses, 196120132000). This finding is consistent with the majority party possessing a significant advantage, either in "buying" vote options, in setting the agenda, or both.},

Our method provides the first test of whether observed values of the widely-used Rice index of party dissimilarity are consistent with a "party-less" null model. It also avoids problems that beset previous estimators. Substantively, we find evidence of party influence in all but one Congress since 1877. Moreover, our indicator of party pressure is systematically higher for the sorts of roll calls that party theorists believe are more pressured-procedural, organizational, and label-defining votes. Our results refute the widespread notion that parties in the House have typically had negligible influence on roll-call voting behavior. They also document important changes in party influence associated with the packing of the Rules Committee in 1961 and the procedural reforms of 1973.},

We characterize the set of Bayesian Nash equilibria under standard assumptions, and show that equilibrium signaling always takes a strikingly simple form, in which S partitions the support of the (scalar) variable that represents his private information and introduces noise into his signal by reporting, in effect, only which element of the partition his observation actually lies in. We show under further assumptions that before S observes his private information, the equilibrium whose partition has the greatest number of elements is Pareto-superior to all other equilibria, and that if agents coordinate on this equilibrium, R's equilibrium expected utility rises when agents' preferences become more similar. Since R bases his choice of action on rational expectations, this establishes a sense in which equilibrium signaling is more informative when agents' preferences are more similar.},

Our method can dynamically track how the relative importance of speakers evolve over time using graph based techniques. Speaker salience is computed based on the eigenvector centrality in a graph representation of participants in a discussion. Two participants in a discussion are linked with an edge if they use similar rhetoric. The method is dynamic in the sense that the graph evolves over time to capture the evolution inherent to the participants salience. We used our method to track the salience of members of the US Senate using data from the US Congressional Record. Our analysis investigated how the salience of speakers changes over time. Our results show that the scores can capture speaker centrality in topics as well as events that result in change of salience or influence among different participants.},

I define a culpable leader as any leader who either presides over the beginning of a war, or comes to power midwar and shares a political connection with a culpable predecessor. Using a data set created specifically for this study, I find that culpable leaders are more likely than nonculpable ones to achieve favorable war outcomes. I also find that domestic audiences will be willing to punish culpable leaders who lose, yet spare nonculpable leaders who do the same. Taken together, my findings underscore the need to appreciate more fully the role individual leaders play in bringing their states to war. },

Big data is about more than just communication: the idea is that people can learn from a large body of information things that they could not comprehend when they used only smaller amounts. Big data is meant to inform, rather than explain; it points toward understanding, but it can still lead to misunderstanding, depending on how well it is wielded. And however dazzling the power of big data appears, its seductive glimmer must never blind people to its inherent imperfections.

This article argues that conflicts with multiple actors who must approve a settlement (veto players) are longer because there are fewer acceptable agreements, information asymmetries are more acute, and shifting alliances and incentives to hold out make negotiation more difficult. This veto player approach to explaining variation in civil war duration is tested using a new dataset containing monthly data on all parties to each civil war begun since World War II. The statistical analysis shows a strong correlation between the number of veto players and the duration of civil war.},

Techniques mainly used in specialized literature will be briefly presented and commented upon, evaluating their sensitivity, advantages and limitations. We conclude that: (a) different measures inevitably are differently sensitive to sleepiness fluctuations; (b) the amount of prior sleep is strongly relevant in quantifying sleepiness levels; (c) subjective and behavioral measures show a higher level of vulnerability to external and motivational factors.},

A prominent aspect of this literature is the study of presidential ratings generated from surveys of both experts and average Americans. A considerable body of research suggests that a relatively small number of factorsâsuch as time in office, intellectual brilliance, and whether a president was assassinatedâexplain a great deal of the variation in the ratings. However, this list of variables includes no indicators of policy performance. We propose two such measuresâone focusing on economic outcomes and one focusing on the outcomes of military conflictâand provide rationales for the hypothesized relationships between these measures of policy performance and presidential ratings. We find evidence of a substantial relationship between economic policy success and presidential ratings.

  Abstract                 = { The standard explanation for the choice of electoral institutions, building on Rokkan&apos;s seminal work, is that proportional representation (PR) was adopted by a divided right to defend its class interests against a rising left. But new evidence shows that PR strengthens the left and redistribution, and we argue the standard view is wrong historically, analytically, and empirically. We offer a radically different explanation. Integrating two opposed interpretations of PR&mdash;minimum winning coalitions versus consensus&mdash;we propose that the right adopted PR when their support for consensual regulatory frameworks, especially those of labor markets and skill formation where co-specific investments were important, outweighed their opposition to the redistributive consequences; this occurred in countries with previously densely organized local economies. In countries with adversarial industrial relations, and weak coordination of business and unions, keeping majoritarian institutions helped contain the left. This explains the close association between current varieties of capitalism and electoral institutions, and why they persist over time.},

First, we consider macroeconomic news and show that it is difficult to explain more than one third of the return variance from this source. Second, to explore the possibility that the stock market responds to information that is omitted from our specifications, we also examine market moves coincident with major political and world events. The relatively small market responses to such news, along with evidence that large market moves often occur on days without any identifiable major news releases, casts doubt on the view that stock price movements are fully explicable by news about future cash flows and discount rates.},

  Abstract                 = {Countries with open capital markets tend to have fewer militarized disputes and wars. Gartzke, Li & Boehmer propose that this association arises from the enhanced ability of states with open capital markets to credibly signal resolve through the bearing of economic costs ex ante to militarized escalation. We test this causal mechanism by qualitatively examining six crucial cases in which the mechanism is most likely to be operative and observable. We employ a formal case selection strategy designed to yield cases with high inferential leverage for our confirmatory test and to select cases for an exploratory analysis of scope conditions. Through analysis of media reports, government documents, and other sources, we evaluate the extent to which relevant individuals drew the appropriate inferences about market-mediated costs and resolve. We conclude that while market-mediated signaling may operate in major conflicts, it is unlikely to account for much of the association between capital openness and peace. Exploratory analysis of our cases identifies potential scope conditions, clarifies the role of different signaling mechanisms, and suggests other explanations for the peaceful behavior of countries with open capital markets.},

We then use it to test an idea that has not been tested directly in the literature: countries' income distributions are important determinants of their import demand, and in particular of the difference in their import demands of luxuries versus necessities. We interpret this result with the aid of a model in which preferences are nonhomothetic, thus relaxing a long-held and standard "but empirically dubious" assumption in the theory of international trade. Our model is strongly borne out by the results: imports of luxuries increase with importing country's inequality, and imports of necessities decrease with it. Our calculations imply that if income distribution in the United States became as equal as in Canada, the US would import about 9--13\% less in luxury goods and 13--19\% more in necessity goods.},

In this note we show that this result depends also on the assumption that the set of alternatives is a continuum. If the pie can be divided only in finitely many different ways (for example, because the pie is an amount of money and there is a smallest money unit), any partition can be obtained as the result of a subgame perfect equilibrium if the time interval between successive offers is sufficiently small. We also show that, for a fixed discount rate, all subgame perfect equilibrium payoffs of the discrete game converge to the solution obtained by Rubinstein if the smallest money unit tends to zero.},

  Abstract                 = {In corporate finance and investment analysis, we assume that there is an investment with a guaranteed return that offers both firms and investors a “risk free” choice. This assumption, innocuous though it may seem, is a critical component of both risk and return models and corporate financial theory. But what if there is no risk free investment? During the banking crisis of 2008, this question came to the fore, as investors began questioning the credit worthiness of US treasuries, UK gilts and German bonds. In effect, the fear that governments can default, hitherto restricted to risky, emerging markets, had seeped into developed markets as well. In this paper, we examine why governments may default, even on local currency bonds, and the consequences. We also look at how best to estimate a risk free rate, when no default free entity exists, and the effects on both investors and firms. In particular, we argue that the absence of a risk free investment will make investors collectively more risk averse, thus reducing the prices of all risky assets, and induce firms to borrow less money and pay out lower dividends.},

  Abstract                 = {What explains the selection of cases for WTO adjudication? This article explores the business conditions under which industries lobby their home government to use the WTO adjudication process and the political factors that influence government decisions. It explains the industry pattern of selection for international trade disputes as a function of the velocity of the business environment. While WTO adjudication is seen as costly and slow, a positive ruling brings broad benefits in terms of deterrence against future discrimination. Firms in static industries will invest in WTO dispute settlement to achieve these benefits, but firms in industries shaped by dynamic competition have high opportunity costs that make them less willing to pursue adjudication. This argument accounts for why there are fewer WTO cases about electronics industry issues than there are likely incidences of protectionist measures. Since Japan is a leading exporter and provides a government report with unique data on potential WTO disputes, it was chosen to test the argument in greater depth. Interviews with Japanese business officials and statistical analysis of an original data set provide support for the argument. The authors conclude that the passive attitude toward WTO adjudication by Japan's largest export industry, electronics, and the sensitivity of japan's diplomatic relations with China have constrained the cases that Japan files. These findings suggest that the effectiveness of the WTO for dispute settlement is conditional upon the time horizon of the industry and the political relations among members.},

Sanctions include the withholding of diplomatic recognition, the boycotting of athletic and cultural events and the sequestering of property of citizens of the targeted country. How- ever, the forms of sanctions that attract the most attention and that are likely have the greatest impact are composed of various restrictions on international trade, financial flows or the movement of people. For sanctions, unlike wars that have long been marked by specific legal codes regarding the behavior of belligerents and âneutralâ third parties, rules were late in emerging and were not as clearly defined as those for wartime.},

This is the case even in Latin America, a region marked by enormous inequalities and by the stunning return of the Left over the last decade. We address this shortcoming. Our game-theoretic model reveals that the probability that the Left candidate is elected follows an inverted U shape relationship. At low levels of inequality, the rich do not bribe any voters and poor voters are increasingly likely to vote for the Left candidate based on redistributive concerns. At high levels of inequality, the rich want to avoid redistribution and bribe poor voters, causing the Left candidate to be elected with decreasing probability. We find support for our hypothesis, using elections in 18 Latin American countries from 1978 to 2008.},

The approach is to take advantage of implicit higher-order structure in the association of terms with documents ("semantic structure") in order to improve the detection of relevant documents on the basis of terms found in queries. The particular technique used is singular-value decomposition, in which a large term by document matrix is decomposed into a set of ca 100 orthogonal factors from which the original matrix can be approximated by linear combination. Documents are represented by ca 100 item vectors of factor weights. Queries are represented as pseudo-document vectors formed from weighted combinations of terms, and documents with supra-threshold cosine values are returned. Initial tests find this completely automatic method for retrieval to be promising.},

  Abstract                 = {Illegal arms are responsible for thousands of deaths in civil wars every year. Yet, their trade is very hard to detect. We propose a method to statistically detect illegal arms trade based on the investor knowledge embedded in financial markets. We focus on eight countries under UN arms embargo in the period 1990-2005, and analyze eighteen events during the embargo that suddenly increase or decrease conflict intensity. If the weapon-making companies are not trading or are trading legally, an event worsening the hostilities should not affect their stock prices or affect them adversely, since it delays the removal of the embargo. Conversely, if the companies are trading illegally, the event may increase stock prices, since it increases the demand for illegal weapons. We detect no significant effect overall. However, we find a large and significant positive reaction for companies head-quartered in countries where the legal and reputation costs of illegal trades are likely to be lower. We identify such countries using measures of corruption and transparency in arms trade. We also suggest a method to detect potential embargo violations based on stock reactions by individual companies, including chains of reactions. The presumed violations are higher for conflicts with more UN investigations and for companies with more Internet stories regarding embargo.},

Financial systems also tend to be more market-based, even after controlling for income, in countries with a common law tradition, strong protection of shareholder rights, good accounting standards, low levels of corruption, and no explicit deposit insurance. What are the relative advantages and disadvantages of bank-based financial systems (as in Germany and Japan) and market-based financial systems (as in England and the United States). Does financial structure matter? In bank-based systems banks play a leading role in mobilizing savings, allocating capital, overseeing the investment decisions of corporate managers, and providing risk management vehicles. In market-based systems securities markets share center stage with banks in getting society's savings to firms, exerting corporate control, and easing risk management. The unresolved debate about whether markets or bank-based intermediaries are more effective at providing financial services hampers the formation of sound policy advice. Demirguc-Kunt and Levine use newly collected data on a cross-section of roughly 150 countries to illustrate how financial systems differ around the world. They (1) analyze how the size, activity, and efficiency of financial systems differ across different per capita income groups, (2) define different indicators of financial structure and identify different patterns as countries become richer, and (3) investigate legal, regulatory, and policy determinants of financial structure after controlling for per capita GDP. A clear pattern emerges: - Banks, other financial intermediaries, and stock markets all grow and become more active and efficient as countries become richer. As income grows, the financial sector develops. - In higher income countries, stock markets become more active and efficient than banks. Thus, financial systems tend to be more market based. - Countries with a common law tradition, strong protection for shareholder rights, good accounting standards, low levels of corruption, and no explicit deposit insurance tend to be more market-based, even after controlling for income. - Countries with a French civil law tradition, poor accounting standards, heavily restricted banking systems, and high inflation generally tend to have underdeveloped financial systems, even after controlling for income. This paper - a product of Finance, Development Research Group - is part of a larger effort in the group to study the impact of financial structure on economic development.},

  Abstract                 = {In the past two decades, in a series of banking crises around the world, banks have become systematically insolvent. These crises have occurred in developed and developing economies alike. To make such financial system breakdowns less likely and to limit their costs if they occur, policymakers feel the need for financial safety nets. These include such policies as implicit or explicit deposit insurance, a lender of last resort function of the central bank, bank insolvency resolution procedures, and bank regulation and supervision. Of these policies, explicit deposit insurance has been gaining popularity in recent years. Since the 1980s the number of countries with explicit deposit insurance schemes almost tripled, with most OECD countries and an increasing number of developing economies adopting some form of explicit depositor protection. In 1994 deposit insurance became the standard for the newly created single banking market of the European Union. Establishing an explicit deposit insurance scheme became part of the generally accepted best practice advice given to developing economies.},

The methodology has been successful in giving good estimates for ‚Äòsmooth‚Äô functions (i.e. continuous and differentiable) as well as functions which are not differentiable, and perhaps not even continuous, at a finite number of points. The methodology is extended to deal with generalized additive models.},

For the Erdos-Renyi graph of N vertices we obtain that the percolation transition of k-cliques takes place when the probability of two vertices being connected by an edge reaches the threshold pc(k)=[(k-1)N]^{-1/(k-1)}. At the transition point the scaling of the giant component with N is highly non-trivial and depends on k. We discuss why clique percolation is a novel and efficient approach to the identification of overlapping communities in large real networks.},

Locally evolved institutional arrangements governed by stable communities and buffered from outside forces have sustained resources successfully for centuries, although they often fail when rapid change occurs.

Promising strategies for addressing these problems include dialogue among interested parties, officials, and scientists; complex, redundant, and layered institutions; a mix of institutional types; and designs that facilitate experimentation, learning, and change.},

  Abstract                 = {To a large degree, conflicts over transboundary freshwater resources arise because property rights have not been clearly defined. International water law provides only hints and suggestions as to how states should resolve their water disputes, since legal principles and clauses are ambiguous and contradictory. But conflict often creates a need for cooperation, which is achieved by means of negotiations, and the specific outcome of negotiations is almost always codified in an international treaty. This article considers bilateral water agreements for rivers with particular geographical configurations and aims to answer a fundamental question: how and why do bilateral treaties vary in their design? Further, it examines international freshwater treaties to deduce the nature of treaty remedies, particularly the side-payment and cost-sharing arrangements, used for resolving conflict over rivers shared by two countries. The theory and testable hypotheses consider geography and economics in order to explore treaty design. In essence, the 'willingness to pay' of one of the states reflects on the property rights solution and can be explained by geography and economics. Three geographical configurations are investigated here. The findings affirm that side-payments frequently occur to offset an asymmetric geographical relationship between upstream and downstream states, and are commonly regarded as an appropriate instrumentality for solving a property rights dispute. Side-payments are non-existent when the geographic relationship among the riparians is symmetric and costs for the joint project are most always equally shared. As expected, in this latter case, the geography of the river acts as a focal point for equal participation. When economic differences are taken into account, especially when the upstream state is richer, the side-payment outcome is reversed. As expected, richer states internalize the costs of taking action in favor of poorer downstream states. When the geographical relationship between the riparians is of a symmetrical nature, while the economic relationship between the states is of an asymmetrical nature, the richer state often assumes the bulk of the cost burden. In this way, it provides a side-payment to the poorer state. Such patterns reveal how property rights disputes over issues such as water quantity, hydropower, pollution abatement, and flood control have been concluded. They suggest how ongoing disputes may be resolved. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

  Abstract                 = {To determine whether a cumulative sleep debt (in a range commonly experienced) would result in cumulative changes in measures of waking neurobehavioral alertness, 16 healthy young adults had their sleep restricted 33\% below habitual sleep duration, to an average 4.98 hours per night [standard deviation (SD) = 0.57] for seven consecutive nights. Subjects slept in the laboratory, and sleep and waking were monitored by staff and actigraphy. Three times each day (1000, 1600, and 2200 hours) subjects were assessed for subjective sleepiness (SSS) and mood (POMS) and were evaluated on a brief performance battery that included psychomotor vigilance (PVT), probed memory (PRM), and serial-addition testing, Once each day they completed a series of visual analog scales (VAS) and reported sleepiness and somatic and cognitive/emotional problems. Sleep restriction resulted in statistically robust cumulative effects on waking functions. SSS ratings, subscale scores for fatigue, confusion, tension, and total mood disturbance from the POMS and VAS ratings of mental exhaustion and stress were evaluated across days of restricted sleep (p = 0.009 to p = 0.0001). PVT performance parameters, including the frequency and duration of lapses, were also significantly increased by restriction (p = 0.018 to p = 0.0001). Significant time-of-day effects were evident in SSS and PVT data, but time-of-day did not interact with the effects of sleep restriction across days. The temporal profiles of cumulative changes in neurobehavioral measures of alertness as a function of sleep restriction were generally consistent. Subjective changes tended to precede performance changes by 1 day, but overall changes in both classes of measure were greatest during the first 2 days (P1, P2) and last 2 days (P6, P7) of sleep restriction. Data from subsets of subjects also showed: 1) that significant decreases in the MSLT occurred during sleep restriction, 2) that the elevated sleepiness and performance deficits continued beyond day 7 of restriction, and 3) that recovery from these deficits appeared to require two full nights of sleep. The cumulative increase in performance lapses across days of sleep restriction correlated closely with MSLT results (r = -0.95) from an earlier comparable experiment by Carskadon and Dement (1). These findings suggest that cumulative nocturnal sleep debt had a dynamic and escalating analog in cumulative daytime sleepiness and that asymptotic or steady-state sleepiness was not achieved in response to sleep restriction.},

  Abstract                 = {Empirical research on the United Nations has been characterized as fragmented, noncumulative, and lacking in the coherence necessary for conceptual integration--a condition at least partly due to the variegated nature of the institution itself. Yet in some important respects the research literature projects a rather homogeneous image. This image is shaped by a prevailing research perspective that treats the U.N. as (1) an arena for the political maneuvering of member states rather than an actor in its own right, and (2) as a resultant of exogenous forces governing world politics rather than as a source of influence affecting the larger world community. One or both of these traits may be found in 36 of 41 research articles published between 1970 and 1977. This perspective probably derives from numerous factors, including the state-centric orientation dominating our discipline and the tendency to view the U.N. as a convenient source of data for the study of world politics.},

  Abstract                 = { Abstract We attempt to recover a function of unknown smoothness from noisy sampled data. We introduce a procedure, SureShrink, that suppresses noise by thresholding the empirical wavelet coefficients. The thresholding is adaptive: A threshold level is assigned to each dyadic resolution level by the principle of minimizing the Stein unbiased estimate of risk (Sure) for threshold estimates. The computational effort of the overall procedure is order N Â· log(N) as a function of the sample size N. SureShrink is smoothness adaptive: If the unknown function contains jumps, then the reconstruction (essentially) does also; if the unknown function has a smooth piece, then the reconstruction is (essentially) as smooth as the mother wavelet will allow. The procedure is in a sense optimally smoothness adaptive: It is near minimax simultaneously over a whole interval of the Besov scale; the size of this interval depends on the choice of mother wavelet. We know from a previous paper by the authors that traditional smoothing methodsâkernels, splines, and orthogonal series estimatesâeven with optimal choices of the smoothing parameter, would be unable to perform in a near-minimax way over many spaces in the Besov scale. Examples of SureShrink are given. The advantages of the method are particularly evident when the underlying function has jump discontinuities on a smooth background. },

  Abstract                 = {SUMMARY With ideal spatial adaptation, an oracle furnishes information about how best to adapt a spatially variable estimator, whether piecewise constant, piecewise polynomial, variable knot spline, or variable bandwidth kernel, to the unknown function. Estimation with the aid of an oracle offers dramatic advantages over traditional linear estimation by nonadaptive kernels; however, it is a priori unclear whether such performance can be obtained by a procedure relying on the data alone. We describe a new principle for spatially-adaptive estimation: selective wavelet reconstruction. We show that variable-knot spline fits and piecewise-polynomial fits, when equipped with an oracle to select the knots, are not dramatically more powerful than selective wavelet reconstruction with an oracle. We develop a practical spatially adaptive method, Risk Shrink, which works by shrinkage of empirical wavelet coefficients. RiskShrink mimics the performance of an oracle for selective wavelet reconstruction as well as it is possible to do so. A new inequality in multivariate normal decision theory which we call the oracle inequality shows that attained performance differs from ideal performance by at most a factor of approximately 2 log n, where n is the sample size. Moreover no estimator can give a better guarantee than this. Within the class of spatially adaptive procedures, RiskShrink is essentially optimal. Relying only on the data, it comes within a factor log2n of the performance of piecewise polynomial and variableknot spline methods equipped with an oracle. In contrast, it is unknown how or if piecewise polynomial methods could be made to function this well when denied access to an oracle and forced to rely on data alone.},

Properties of this simple structure are surprisingly close to those of growing random scale-free networks with $\gamma$ in the most interesting region, between 2 and 3. We succeed to find exactly and numerically with high precision all main characteristics of the graph. In particular, we obtain the exact shortest-path-length distribution. For the large network ($\ln N \gg 1$) the distribution tends to a Gaussian of width $\sim \sqrt{\ln N}$ centered at $\bar{\ell} \sim \ln N$. We show that the eigenvalue spectrum of the adjacency matrix of the graph has a power-law tail with exponent $2+\gamma$.},

The calculations of the relative sizes of all the giant components are demonstrated using the simplest examples.

There are, however, good theoretical arguments to suspect that trade in some goods should have a bigger impact on the likelihood of conflict than trade in others. This article examines the relationship between trade and conflict at a lower level of aggregation. It discusses various theoretical arguments why the relationship between trade and conflict should vary across industry sectors, particularly strategic trade, asset specificity, and possible appropriation of gains from trade. The central hypotheses are tested using dyadic United Nations trade data disaggregated at industry level from 1970 to 1997. The main findings are that trade generally reduces the likelihood of conflict, the relationship is weaker for commodities that are more easily appropriable by force, and the relationship is generally stronger for manufactured goods with the notable exceptions of chemical and metal industries and the high-technology sector.},

  Abstract                 = {"Domestic politics matters" has become a rallying cry for international relations scholars over the past decade, yet the question still remains: Just how does it matter? In this book, George Downs and David Rocke argue that an important part of the international impact of domestic politics springs from the institutional responses to its many uncertainties. This impact is due not so much to the errors in judgment these uncertainties can cause as to the strategic and institutional consequences of knowing that such errors are possible. The heart of the book is its formal analysis of how three kinds of domestic uncertainty have shaped international relations through their influence on three very different institutions. One chapter deals with the decision rules that citizens create to cope with uncertainty about the quality of their representation, and how these can lead to the paradoxical "gambling for resurrection" effect. Another chapter describes the extent to which the weak enforcement provisions of GATT can be understood as a mechanism to cope with uncertain but intermittent interest group demands for protection. The third chapter looks at the impact of uncertainty on the creation, survival, and membership of multilateral regulatory institutions, such as the Montreal Protocol and EU, when some states question the capacity of other states to meet their treaty obligations.},

  Abstract                 = {The problem of ensuring that chief executives act in accordance with the wishes of their constituency is particularly acute in the area of foreign intervention where the head of state can be expected to possess substantial information advantages. This paper presents a formal analysis of strategies that can be used to deter overly passive and overly aggressive executives and a discussion of their side effects. The typically large amount of uncertainty means that the constituency must base its decision to retain an executive on the outcome of a conflict and not on its apparent ex ante advisability. This uncertainty imposes a cost on the constituency, who may remove an effective, "innocent" executive unnecessarily, and it also imposes a cost on the well-meaning executive, who may be removed from office after making the best possible decision in a difficult case. The mechanism necessary to deter executive adventurism also causes the paradoxical "gambling for resurrection" effect, in which an unsuccessful war that a well-informed principal would terminate is continued because cessation would, given the current state of the world, cause the agent to be removed from office.},

Although this is well known, relatively few attempts have been made to explain it at a general level or to explore its implications. In this paper we show why states that desire to create a multilateral organization or agreement might be attracted to a strategy that involves admitting potential members sequentially based on their preferences. Such a "sequential construction" strategy can generate an unusual kind of structure-induced equilibrium that dramatically mitigates the breadth-depth trade-off and increases the level of cooperation a multilateral is able to attain. We evaluate these claims with data drawn from the history of the European Union and twenty environmental multilaterals.},

  Abstract                 = {International peacebuilding can improve the prospects that a civil war will be resolved. Although peacebuilding strategies must be designed to address particular conflicts, broad parameters that fit most conflicts can be identified. Strategies should address the local roots of hostility, the local capacities for change, and the (net) specific degree of international commitment available to assist sustainable peace. One can conceive of these as the three dimensions of a triangle whose area is the "political space"-or effective capacity-for building peace. We test these propositions with an extensive data set of 124 post-World War II civil wars and find that multilateral, United Nations peace operations make a positive difference. UN peacekeeping is positively correlated with democratization processes after civil war, and multilateral enforcement operations are usually successful in ending the violence. Our study provides broad guidelines for designing the appropriate peacebuilding strategy, given the mix of hostility, local capacities, and international capacities.},

Other areas of domestic policy-making considered in the analysis include market access, governance, government budget, structural reforms, trade and investment arrangements with regional partners and macroeconomic management. We find that no precise blueprint of accession conditions can be ascertained, that WTO played a role, albeit not an exclusive one in the process of liberalization, that the costs of WTO Membership are not negligible, that the benefits of WTO Membership are also significant in terms of a better market access, improved governance and a recourse to better economic policies.},

Many key strategic decisions firms make involve discrete choices such as deciding the location of a new store, determining where in product space to position a product, or what options to offer in a service contract. These decisions are fairly complex and typically involve the consideration of a number of demand, cost, and competitive factors. What makes these discrete choices particularly interesting (and challenging to analyze) is that they are interrelated with the choices of other firms because firms take into account the actions of their competitors when making their own decisions. We describe the basic problem of dealing with interrelated discrete choices in a game-theoretic framework and present the various estimation methods available. A discussion of the existing applications and future research opportunities concludes the article.},

We demonstrate how the Gibbs distribution emerges in computer simulations of economic models. Then we consider a thermal machine, in which the difference of temperatures allows one to extract a monetary profit. We also discuss the role of debt, and models with broken time-reversal symmetry for which the Gibbs law does not hold.},

We reassess the fiscal position of Habsburg Castile, deriving comprehensive estimates of revenue, debt, and expenditure from new archival data. The king's debts were sustainable. Primary surpluses were large and rising. Debt-to-revenue ratios remained broadly unchanged during Philip's reign. Castilian finances in the sixteenth century compare favorably with those of other early modern fiscal states at the height of their imperial ambitions, including Britain. The defaults of Philip II therefore reflected short-term liquidity crises, and were not a sign of unsustainable debts. },

  Abstract                 = {Scholars and policymakers generally assume that multilateral cooperation is a necessary condition for economic sanctions to be of any use. However, previous statistical tests of this assumption have shown that sanctions are more successful with lower levels of cooperation. This puzzle calls into question established theories of economic statecraft as well as theories of international cooperation. In this article I test possible explanations for the ineffectiveness of multilateral cooperation on sanctions events using James Fearon's (1998) breakdown of cooperation into bargaining and enforcement phases as a framework for discussion. The empirical results show that when multilateral economic sanctions fail, their failure is due to enforcement, not bargaining problems. Without the support of an international organization, cooperating states backslide from promises of cooperation. Backsliding occurs because of domestic political pressures and uncertainty about the intentions of the other sanctioning countries; backsliding causes an initial burst of cooperative behavior to decay over time. Without institutional support, cooperation is worse than useless-it is counterproductive. This result suggests that international cooperation is a more fragile equilibrium than previously thought but under-cuts realist arguments that international organizations are unimportant.},

It is important, however, to recognize the limits of both the Rational Design project in its current form and the conclusions that can be drawn from the special issue about the project's usefulness and validity. This article evaluates the project on its own terms, as a rationalist attempt to explain variation in international institutions. I identify three significant sets of limitations: those of the scope of the project, those of the analytical framework, and those of the efforts that are made to evaluate the framework through empirical analysis. Although the first set of limitations is largely a matter of choice, the last two raise questions about how much of an advance the special issue in fact represents. Nevertheless, these shortcomings are not absolute-they can be remedied through further theoretical and empirical research.},

I exploit a unique data set to reliably estimate annual rates of gun ownership at both the state and the county levels during the past two decades. My findings demonstrate that changes in gun ownership are significantly positively related to changes in the homicide rate, with this relationship driven almost entirely by an impact of gun ownership on murders in which a gun is used. The effect of gun ownership on all other crime categories is much less marked. Recent reductions in the fraction of households owning a gun can explain oneâthird of the differential decline in gun homicides relative to nongun homicides since 1993.},

  Abstract                 = {We have previously described an extension of the vector retrieval method called "Latent Semantic Indexing" (LSI) (Deerwester, et al., 1990; Dumais, et al., 1988; Furnas, et al., 1988). The LSI approach partially overcomes the problem of variability in human word choice by automatically organizing objects into a "semantic" structure more appropriate for information retrieval. This is done by modeling the implicit higher-order structure in the association of terms with objects. Initial tests find this completely automatic method to be a promising way to improve users' access to many kinds of textual materials or to objects for which textual descriptions are available. This paper describes some enhancements to the basic LSI method, including differential term weighting and relevance feedback. Appropriate term weighting improves performance by an average of 40\%, and feedback based on 3 relevant documents improves performance by an average of 67\%.},

  Abstract                 = {A major barrier to successful retrieval from external sources (e.g., electronic databases) is the tremendous variability in the words that people use to describe objects of interest. The fact that different authors use different words to describe essentially the same idea means that relevant objects will be missed; conversely, the fact that the same word can be used to refer to many different things means that irrelevant objects will be retrieved. We describe a statistical method called latent semantic indexing, which models the implicit higher order structure in the association of words and objects and improves retrieval performance by up to 30\%. Additional large perfor- mance improvements of 40\% and 67\% can be achieved through the use of differential term weighting and iterative retrieval methods.},

Computational comparisons are made with the previous standard method. Two applications are provided to illustrate the use of the simulation smoother for Gibbs sampling for Bayesian inference and importance sampling for classical inference.},

  Abstract                 = {Trade policy depends on the extent to which the government wants to redistribute income as well as on a country's overall factor endowments and their distribution. While the government's desire to redistribute income itself is dependent on asset distribution, it is to a large extent also driven by the partisan nature of the government, i.e., whether it is pro-labor or pro-capital. Using cross-country data on factor endowments, inequality and government orientation, we find that, conditional on inequality, left-wing (pro-labor) governments will adopt more protectionist trade policies in capital-rich countries, but adopt more pro-trade policies in labor-rich economies than right-wing (pro-capital) ones. Also, holding government orientation constant, higher inequality is associated with higher protection in capital-abundant countries while it is associated with lower protection in labor-abundant countries. These results are consistent with the simultaneous presence of both inequality as well as ideology as determinants of protection within a two-factor, two-sector Heckscher-Ohlin framework. Overall, various statistical tests support an umbrella model (that combines both the ideology and inequality models) over each of the individual models. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

  Abstract                 = {In this paper, we investigate empirically how government ideology affects trade policy. The prediction of a partisan, ideology-based model (within a two-sector, two-factor Heckscher-Ohlin framework) is that left-wing governments will adopt more protectionist trade policies in capital-rich countries, but adopt more pro-trade policies in labor-rich countries, than right-wing ones. The data strongly support this prediction in a very robust fashion. There is some evidence that this relationship may hold better in democracies than in dictatorships, though the magnitude of the partisan effect seems stronger in dictatorships.},

  Abstract                 = {Numerous anecdotal reports suggest that members of many territorial species use naturally occurring landmarks to define the boundaries of their territories. In the work reported here, we first tested whether artificial landmarks would be adopted as boundaries by territorial male cicada killer wasps, Sphecius speciosus . To perform this test, we set out wooden dowels on a flat, grassy lawn on which male wasps were defending mating territories. The dowels were situated so that they did not coincide with any existing territorial boundary. After we provided the dowels, the wasps established new territorial boundaries coinciding with the dowels. We hypothesized that using visual landmarks as territorial borders might lower defensive costs, and indeed, focal samples on territorial wasps revealed that borders that were defined by dowels cost less to defend than did borders that were not defined by any landmark. This result suggests that the use of natural landmarks as territorial boundaries may have evolved as a result of the reduced defensive costs that accrue to these boundaries. Furthermore, defensive costs may not depend directly on territory size: territory owners may be able to reduce defensive costs by selecting sites with high tactical defensibility.},

  Abstract                 = {We derive an econometric test for the presence of monotone comparative statics in models with multiple equilibria. The test is solely based on the monotone comparative statics predictions; hence it applies to many economic models (examples are: single-person decision, IO, macroeconomic and game-theory models). The assumptions of our econometric model are fairly weak. We remain fully agnostic about the number of equilibria, their true values and the corresponding probabilities. In particular, we make no assumptions about the equilibrium selection procedure. Our approach mainly exploits the statistical properties of extreme (large and small) observations of the endogenous variable, which we show to hold inâarguablyâgeneral cases. We show that a non-regression-based approach to testing is possible in our context, and develop a likelihood ratio test based on conditional quantiles of the endogenous variable. The test is an asymptotic extension of a âchi-barâ squared test initially proposed by Bartholomew (1959a,b).},

Various empirical measures used to gauge the presence of controls on capital account transactions and the liberalization of equity markets are discussed. We compare detailed measures of capital account controls that attempt to capture the intensity of enforcement with other indicators that simply capture whether controls are present. A detailed review of the literature is followed by an empirical section in which we trace the divergence in published results to differences in country coverage, sample periods, indicators of liberalization, and control variables across studies. Specifically, we show that when an institutional variable such as government reputation is added to the specification, the significance of capital account openness vanishes. Also, we demonstrate that enriching the specification by allowing for nonlinearities helps explain why different studies that ignore the nonlinear nature of the relationship find different results.},

We examine this question in the context of India's 1991 tariff reforms. Overall, in the 1990s, rural India experienced a dramatic increase in schooling and decline in child labor. However, communities that relied heavily on employment in protected industries before liberalization do not experience as large an increase in schooling or decline in child labor. The data suggest that this failure to follow the national trend of increasing schooling and diminishing work is associated with a failure to follow the national trend in poverty reduction. Schooling costs appear to play a large role in this relationship between poverty, schooling, and child labor. Extrapolating from our results, our estimates imply that roughly half of India's rise in schooling and a third of the fall in child labor during the 1990s can be explained by falling poverty and therefore improved capacity to afford schooling.},

Illiberal states sought seats to shield themselves or neighbors from censure by the Commission.

There is a brief discussion of objectivity in statistical analyses and of the difficulties of achieving objectivity within a Bayesian framework.

  Abstract                 = {This paper investigates hypotheses about the determinants of trade and investment liberalisation with a particular focus on the market access and national treatment commitments under the General Agreement on Trade in Services (GATS). We set up a database of these GATS commitments and use the ratio of all commitments listed by a country to the possible number of commitments as a measure of liberalisation of market access/national treatment. Our empirical analysis suggests that larger and `richer' countries commit to more liberal regimes of market access and national treatment. This is surprising since economic theory predicts the largest welfare gains for low-skilled abundant (skilled-labour/physical-capital-scarce) economies. Also, our findings suggest that liberalisation is stronger among geographically close countries with strong ties in goods trade.},

In particular, a countryÃÆÃ¢â¬Å¡ÃâÃ¢â¬â¢s choice of participating in a preferential trade agreement (PTA) depends on the choice of other economies to participate therein. However, recent empirical work on the determinants of PTA formation assumes that countries are independent in that regard. This paper lays out an empirical analysis to study the role of interdependencies in PTA membership in a large data-set of 15, 753 country-pairs. Applying modern econometric techniques, a PTA membership is found to create an incentive for other country-pairs to participate in a PTA as well. Especially, countries have an incentive to participate in the same PTA if their neighbors are members already.},

This article introduces a more general institutional theory that argues that the number of access points provided by institutions is the crucial institutional feature, as increasing the number of access points makes lobbying less costly, which benefits protectionists. From this, I hypothesize that the number of parties in government, the number of electoral districts, the nature of the vote, and other such institutions affect the level of protection and that, once these factors are controlled for, proportional representation has no impact on trade policy. I test this theory on tariff data in the post-World War 11 developed democracies and find broad support for these hypotheses.},

  Abstract                 = {The authors estimate a model of the job approval ratings of President George W. Bush that includes five sets of variables: a "honeymoon" effect, an autoregressive function that tracks a decline in approval, measures of economic performance, measures of important "rally events," and a measure of the costs of warâin this case, the U.S. death toll in the Iraq War. Several significant effects are found, including the rally that followed the attacks of September 11, 2001; the commencement of the war in Iraq; and the capture of Baghdad in April 2003. Since the beginning of the war in Iraq, however, the casualties of war have had a significant negative impact on Bush's approval ratings. Although the effects of additional battle deaths in Iraq will decrease approval only marginally, results suggest that there is also little prospect for sustained improvement so long as casualties continue to accumulate.},

We report evidence that commercial policies attenuated prior connections between income growth and trade, and that exchange rate instability marginally discouraged international trade. In contrast, the tendency toward regionalization commonly ascribed to the formation of trade and currency blocs was already evident to a considerable extent prior to the regional policy initiatives of the 1930s. This reorientation is more properly attributed to ongoing historical forces such as commercial and financial links between countries forged over many years.},

Our analysis differs from its predecessors in three ways. We seek to uncover general patterns by considering as long a period as possible and all countries with the relevant data. We consider multiple dimensions of globalization, analyzing both trade liberalization and capital account liberalization. And we estimate these relationships using an instrumental variables strategy that allows us to confront the issue of simultaneity.

Some argue that democracy and globalisation go hand in hand suggesting that unrestricted international transactions leads to increased political accountability and transparency. And, politically free societies are likely to have minimal restrictions on the mobility of goods and services across national borders. Others argue that the causal relationship should be reversed: democracies are more likely to have closed markets and vice versa. We examine these relationships between political democracy and trade and financial globalisation over the period 1870-2000 and treat both democracy and globalisation as both cause and effect. Our empirical strategy uses instrumental variables and estimates relationships using the Generalised Method of Moments framework. Our general findings support the hypothesis of a positive two-way relationship between democracy and globalisation.},

  Abstract                 = {Strong seasonality in demand, a short product life cycle, and the absence of any price competition make the release date of first-run movies one of the main strategic decisions taken by moviesâ distributors. Movies are typically released on a Friday within a short release season, thus making the release decision a discrete one. In estimating the discrete timing game, just as in many other competitive environments, the identity of the competing players matters: high quality movie is a tougher competitor than a low quality one. Such heterogeneity in the toughness of competition among potential rivals cannot be accommodated by the existing empirical models of discrete games. Therefore, this paper constructs a new empirical model for such games, which imposes no restrictions on the payoff structure. The model is of a sequential-move game with asymmetric information. The Perfect Bayesian Equilibrium of the game can be found using a simple pseudo backward introduction algorithm. The conceptual multiplicity of equilibria problem is solved for by the sequential structure, while the asymmetric information structure avoids the typical complex regions of integration, thus leading to a relative computational simplicity. By using some of the demand estimates computed in Einav (2003), the estimation results of the movie-release timing game suggest that release dates of movies are too clustered, and that too many good movies are released on holiday weekends. This suggests that more revenues could have been made by shifting some of the holiday releases by one or two weeks. Alternative explanations for these results are discussed.},

The discrete-time stochastic model (DSM), which can handle small and moderately large force levels, is based on single shot kill probabilities. Forces are assumed to be heterogeneous on both sides, and both directed and area fire types are modeled by means of combinatorial analysis. DSM considers overkills and can handle noncombat loss and engagement processes, discrete reinforcements, force combinations and divisions. In addition to experimenting with DSM, we estimate attrition rate coefficients used in Lanchester combat models, such that the two models will yield similar figures for force levels throughout the combat.},

  Abstract                 = { ABSTRACT Over the past forty-five years, bilateral investment treaties (BITs) have become the most important international legal mechanism for the encouragement and governance of foreign direct investment. The proliferation of BITs during the past two decades in particular has been phenomenal. These intergovernmental treaties typically grant extensive rights to foreign investors, including protection of contractual rights and the right to international arbitration in the event of an investment dispute. How can we explain the widespread adoption of BITs? We argue that the spread of BITs is driven by international competition among potential host countries&mdash;typically developing countries&mdash;for foreign direct investment. We propose a set of hypotheses that derive from such an explanation and develop a set of empirical tests that rely on network measures of economic competition as well as more indirect evidence of competitive pressures on the host to sign BITs. The evidence suggests that potential hosts are more likely to sign BITs when their competitors have done so. We find some evidence that coercion and learning play a role, but less support for cultural explanations based on emulation. Our main finding is that the diffusion of BITs is associated with competitive economic pressures among developing countries to capture a share of foreign investment. We are agnostic at this point about the benefits of this competition for development.For useful comments on earlier drafts of this article, we thank Bill Bernhard, Bear Braumoeller, Frank Dobbin, Robert Franzese, Jeffry Frieden, Geoffrey Garrett, Tom Ginsburg, Jude Hays, Lisa Martin, Bob Pahre, Mark Ramsayer, Steven Ratner, Susan Rose-Ackerman, and John Sides.

This paper documents the slowdown and notes that a substantial part is due to journals requiring more extensive revisions. A num- ber of potential explanations are considered: a democratization of the publishing process; increases in the complexity of papers; the growth of the profession; and simple cost and benefit arguments. Various time series are examined for evidence that the economics profes- sion has changed. Paper-level data on review times are used to assess connections between underlying changes in the profession and changes in the review process. Evidence is found to support some explanations, but the majority of the slowdown remains unexplained. The changes may reflect evolving social norms.},

  Abstract                 = {The validity of Lanchester's equations is demonstrated in an actual combat situation where U.S. forces captured the island of Iwo Jima. The equations tested are dM/dt=P(t)-AN, and dN/dt=-BM, with t the time elapsed since the beginning of the engagement, measured in days; M(t), and N(t) the number of effective friendly and enemy troops, respectively; A and B the friendly and enemy combat loss rates, respectively, per opposing combatant; and P(t) the rate friendly troops enter combat. Information required for the verification is the number of friendly troops put ashore each day and the number of friendly casualties for each day of the engagement, knowledge that enemy troops are not reinforced or withdrawn, the number of enemy troops at the beginning and end of the engagement, and the time T at the end of the engagement. If the number of enemy troops at the beginning of the engagement is not known, but the time, T, when the enemy is destroyed is known, it is still possible to determine whether Lanchester's equations are valid. In the analysis of the capture of Iwo Jima, the equations were found to be applicable. The value of such analyses increases when repeated often enough to permit general conclusions to be drawn.},

The Eleventh Amendment to the United States Constitution prevented foreign creditors from obtaining payment in the federal courts. Moreover, because the defaulting states were part of a large and economically integrated nation, creditors could not enforce payment by imposing military or trade sanctions. In spite of the lack of sanctions, however, most states eventually repaid in full. It appears that the states repaid in order to maintain access to capital markets, much as in reputational models of sovereign debt.},

  Abstract                 = {David Epstein and Sharyn OHalloran produce the first unified theory of policy making between the legislative and executive branches. Examining major US policy initiatives from 1947 to 1992, the authors describe the conditions under which the legislature narrowly constrains executive discretion, and when it delegates authority to the bureaucracy. In doing so, the authors synthesize diverse and competitive literatures, from transaction cost and principal-agent theory in economics, to information models developed in both economics and political science, to substantive and theoretical work on legislative organization and on bureaucratic discretion. Professors Epstein and OHalloran produce their own deductive specification of the conditions for making or delegating policy, gather a rich, original data set on delegation and discretion in the postwar era to test the propositions derived from their model, and devise appropriate statistical tests to assess the validity of their propositions. With implications for the study of constitutional design, political delegation, legislative organization, administrative law, and the role of the executive in policy making, this book redefines the study of legislative-executive relations under separate powers.},

We show, however, that only under very limited circumstances will there be an observable relationship between fundraising and challenger quality. Therefore, previous empirical tests for deterrence have systematically underestimated the effects of fundraising in decreasing electoral competition. Our analysis also suggests that by making fundraising easily observable, Federal Election Commission regulations may encourage candidates to overinvest time and resources accumulating large war chests instead of governing.},

Specifically, we ask whether the Court has worked to constrain minor parties or to facilitate their efforts to become meaningful political entities. Our examination of litigation involving political parties depicts a Court that has remained "neutral" toward minor and major parties; indeed, we found some evidence of a positive relationship between minor parties and Court decisions, but only after we controlled for three other variables: cycles of American politics, case issues, and Court eras. These and other findings lead us to a number of conclusions about the role the Court plays in the American political system.},

  Abstract                 = {To say that positive political theory (PPT) scholarship on the hierarchy of justice is theory rich and data poor is to make a rather uncontroversial claim. For over a decade now, scholars have offered intriguing theoretical accounts aimed at understanding why lower courts defy (comply with) higher courts. But only rarely do they subject the accounts to rigorous empirical interrogation. The chief obstacle, it seems, is the lack of a reliable and valid measurement strategy for placing judges of lower courts and justices of higher courts in the same policy space. Without such a strategy, we can systematically test few, if any, hypotheses flowing from PPT models of the judicial hierarchy. With such an approach not only can we investigate the implications of these models, we can assess many others flowing from the larger PPT program on judging, as well. It is to the challenge of scaling judges and justices (as well as legislatures and executives) that we turn in this article. We begin by explicating our measurement strategy, and then by explaining its advantages over previous efforts. Next we explore the results of our approach and provide a descriptive look at data it yields: a "Judicial Common Space" (JCS) score for all justices and judges appointed since 1953. The last section offers three applications designed to shore up the suitability and adaptability of the JCS for a range of positive projects on the courts.},

  Abstract                 = {Motivation: The ability to detect regions of genetic alteration is of great importance in cancer research. These alterations can take the form of large chromosomal gains and losses as well as smaller amplifications and deletions. The detection of such regions allows researchers to identify genes involved in cancer progression, and to fully understand differences between cancer and non-cancer tissue. The Bayesian method proposed by Barry and Hartigan is well suited for the analysis of such change point problems. In our previous article we introduced the R package bcp (Bayesian change point), an MCMC implementation of Barry and Hartigan's method. In a simulation study and real data examples, bcp is shown to both accurately detect change points and estimate segment means. Earlier versions of bcp (prior to 2.0) are O(n2) in speed and O(n) in memory (where n is the number of observations), and run in ∼45 min for a sequence of length 10 000. With the high resolution of newer microarrays, the number of computations in the O(n2) algorithm is prohibitively time-intensive.Results: We present a new implementation of the Bayesian change point method that is O(n) in both speed and memory; bcp 2.1 runs in ∼45 s on a single processor with a sequence of length 10 000—a tremendous speed gain. Further speed improvements are possible using parallel computing, supported in bcp via NetWorkSpaces. In simulated and real microarray data from the literature, bcp is shown to quickly and accurately detect aberrations of varying width and magnitude.Availability: The R package bcp is available on CRAN (R Development Core Team, 2008). The O(n) version is available in version 2.0 or higher, with support for NetWorkSpaces in versions 2.1 and higher},

It analyses the behaviour of individual firms exploring profit opportunities in an evolving market place and derives optimal policies, including exit, in this environment. Then it adds an entry process and aggregates the optimal behaviour of all firms, including potential entrants, into a rational expectations, Markov-perfect industry equilibrium, and proves ergodicity of the equilibrium process. Numerical examples are used to illustrate the more detailed characteristics of the stochastic process generating industry structures that result from this equilibrium.},

I introduce the first formal test for the existence of a substantively meaningful relationship in quantitative data. The test takes a rational choice perspective toward evidence, using Bayesian statistical decision theory to ask whether it makes sense to act on a statistical relationship given a researcherâs view of the consequences of correct and incorrect decisions. In the context of academic research, the test statistic câ has a clear interpretation: if a relationship of size câ is not important enough to influence future research and policy advice, then the evidence does not support the existence of a substantively significant effect. A replication of findings from the American Journal of Political Science and Journal of Politics illustrates that statistical significance at con- ventional levels is neither necessary nor sufficient to accept a hypothesis of substantive significance using câ . I make software packages available for Stata and R that allow political scientists to easily use câ for inference in their own research.},

As a consequence, states face asymmetric information when interacting with one another and will presumably try to learn about each others' private characteristics by observing each others' behavior. A satisfying statistical treatment would account for the existence of asymmetric information and model the learning process. This study develops a formal and statistical framework for incomplete information games that we term the Bayesian Quantal Response Equilibrium Model (BQRE model). Our BQRE model offers three advantages over existing work: it directly incorporates asymmetric information into the statistical model's structure, estimates the influence of private information characteristics on behavior, and mimics the temporal learning process that we believe takes place in international politics.},

On the other hand, the more control over the water basin any given country has, the less likely it will be involved in a treaty. The results also support aspects of two competing theories about the role of country differences, that in some cases they serve as obstacles to treaty formation yet in other cases they encourage treaty formation to formalize management when informal arrangements are not adequate.},

  Abstract                 = {According to the Washington Consensus, developing countries? growth would benefit from a reduction in tariffs and other barriers to trade. But a backlash against this view now suggests that trade policies have little or no impact on growth. If "getting policies right" is wrong or infeasible, this leaves only the more tenuous objective of "getting institutions right" (Easterly 2005, Rodrik 2006). However, the empirical basis for judging recent trade reforms is weak. Econometrics are mostly ad hoc; results are typically not judged against models; trade policies are poorly measured (or not measured at all, as when trade volumes are spuriously used); and the most influential studies in the literature are based on pre-1990 experience (which predates the "Great Liberalization" in developing countries which followed the GATT Uruguay Round). We address all of these concerns -- by using a model-based analysis which highlights tariffs on capital and intermediate goods; by compiling new disaggregated tariff measures to empirically test the model; and by employing a treatment-and-control empirical analysis of pre- versus post-1990 performance of liberalizing and nonliberalizing countries. We find evidence that a specific treatment, liberalizing tariffs on imported capital and intermediate goods, did lead to faster GDP growth, and by a margin consistent with theory (about 1 percentage point per annum). Endogeneity problems are considered and other observations are consistent with the proposed mechanism: changes to other tariffs, e.g. on consumption goods, though collinear with general tariffs reforms, are more weakly correlated with growth outcomes; and the treatment and control groups display different behavior of investment prices and quantities, and capital flows.},

  Abstract                 = {This paper develops a model for understanding end-user order flow in the FX market. The model addresses several puzzling findings. First, the estimated price-impact of flow from different end-user segments is, dollar-for-dollar, quite different. Second, order flow from segments traditionally thought to be liquidity-motivated actually has power to forecast exchange rates. Third, about one third of order flow's power to forecast exchange rates one month ahead comes from flow's ability to forecast future flow, whereas the remaining two-thirds applies to price components unrelated to future flow. We show that all of these features arise naturally from end-user heterogeneity, in a setting where order flow provides timely information to market-makers about the state of the macroeconomy.},

  Abstract                 = {In recent years the benefits of WTO membership has been called into question, notably in the context of discussions on WTO accessions. Previously it was widely thought that better access to the markets of existing WTO members was the quid pro quo for adopting commitments to reform domestic policies, including border measures. Here we revisit this matter and do so by focusing on the accessions to the WTO and its predecessor the {GATT} of four nations: Angola, Bulgaria, Ecuador, and Jordan. For each country, first, we go to considerable length to establish the factual record concerning the evolution of each nationÃÆÃ¢â¬Å¡ÃâÃ¢â¬â¢s trade flows and their recent macroeconomic performance. Then, using two methodologies, we examine whether national exports and imports responded positively after accession.},

  Abstract                 = {It is often argued that the quid pro quo for accepting WTO commitments on national trade barriers and other policies is improved access to foreign markets. In this study disaggregated information on exports by two developing countries (Bulgaria and Ecuador) and on the trade barriers of the Quad industrialised countries is employed to evaluate two hypotheses concerning the benefits of WTO membership. We cannot reject the hypothesis that post-accession Bulgarian export growth was faster in those product lines that saw larger reductions in MFN tariff rates in the Quad countries. Nor can we reject the hypothesis that Ecuadorian export growth was higher in those product lines where the gap between MFN and GSP rates narrowed faster, suggesting that a reduction in the uncertainty over the terms of their market access to foreign markets has encouraged that countryÃÆÃ¢â¬Å¡ÃâÃ¢â¬â¢s firms to ship more goods to the leading industrialised economies.},

As a test, we used MavenRank to identify the most influential members of the US Senate using data from the US Congressional Record and used committee ranking to evaluate the output. Our results show that MavenRank scores are largely driven by committee status in most topics, but can capture speaker centrality in topics where speeches are used to indicate ideological position instead of influence legislation.},

Evidence presented here, on the other hand, is consistent with changes in the cost of pursuing a common preference influencing policy. I draw this evidence from a panel of Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) votes and find support for the following conclusions: (1) Federal Reserve Board (FRB) governors who were nominated and confirmed by the same party (Republican or Democrat) prefer significantly looser policy than do other FOMC members. (2) Monetary policy is significantly looser when either party controls the oversight mechanism (i.e., the presidency and Senate) than when control is split. (3) Oversight acts less forcefully on district bank presidents than on FRB governors. In short, the present evidence suggests that political agents from both parties prefer loose money and pursue this preference more efficiently when their parties are aligned.},

  Abstract                 = {A powerful country that intervenes in a violent crisis has a better chance than any other intermediary to negotiate a peace agreement. With its superior military strength, it can change the embattled parties' cost-benefit calculus by threatening punishments and promising rewards. But peace negotiations organized by major powers often fail because disputants find themselves uncertain about the third party's intentions, and they do not believe the intermediary will make good on its promises. What motivates major powers to intervene in conflicts? Why do some use military coercion in negotiating settlements, while others choose to mediate by helping the disputed sides communicate effectively? When can powerful countries succeed in efforts to end war? In my dissertation, I show how biasÃÆÃ¢â¬Å¡ÃâÃ¢â¬âa close alignment of preferences between a major power and one of the parties involved in an international disputeÃÆÃ¢â¬Å¡ÃâÃ¢â¬âaffects the manner and the outcome of intervention bargaining. I find that biased major powers make effective third parties because they have a highly credible threat to use force against the less favored belligerent. Such biased interveners nonetheless prefer to coerce under the guise of mediation because, in doing so, they can extract concessions in a less costly, private setting. These intervention efforts are more likely to succeed precisely because disputants expect coercion in the event that settlement talks fail.

The algorithm is simple, can scale well to large data sets, and avoids the problem of diagnosing convergence that is present with Monte Carlo Markov Chain (MCMC) approaches to this problem.

  Abstract                 = {Five factors are shown to be strongly related to civil war duration. Civil wars emerging from coups or revolutions tend to be short. Civil wars in Eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union have also tended to be relatively brief, as have anti-colonial wars. By contrast, "sons of the soil" wars that typically involve land conflict between a peripheral ethnic minority and state-supported migrants of a dominant ethnic group are on average quite long-lived. So are conflicts in which a rebel group derives major funding from contraband such as opium, diamonds, or coca. The article seeks to explain these regularities, developing a game model focused on the puzzle of what prevents negotiated settlements to long-running, destructive civil wars for which conflicting military expectations are an implausible explanation. In the model, regional autonomy deals may be unreachable when fluctuations in state strength undermine the government's ability to commit. The commitment problem binds harder when the center has an enduring political or economic interest in expansion into the periphery, as in "sons of the soil" wars, and when either government or rebels are able to earn some income during a conflict despite the costs of fighting, as in the case of contraband funding.},

  Abstract                 = {The empirical question of how often deterrent threats issued during international disputes succeed has been hotly debated for years, with some researchers arguing that virtually no robust cases of success can be identified. I argue that what appears to be an empirical and methodological debate actually arises from the inadequacy of classical rational deterrence theory, which fails to comprehend the implications of states' strategic self-selection into international disputes. Rational self-selection is shown to imply that in a sample of crises, deterrent threats issued after an initial challenge will tend to fail in precisely those cases where they are relatively most credible signals of an intent to resist with force. The product of a selection effect, this paradoxical implication allows a resolution of the debate on the efficacy of deterrence in crises. And because selection effects can arise whenever a historical case is the product of choices by actors who also influence the outcome in question, this example from the study of deterrence has broad relevance for empirical research.},

  Abstract                 = {The author distinguishes between two types of costly signals that state leaders might employ in trying to credibly communicate their foreign policy interests to other states, whether in the realm of grand strategy or crisis diplomacy. Leaders might either (a) tie hands by creating audience costs that they will suffer ex post if they do not follow through on their threat or commitment (i.e., costs arising from the actions of domestic political audiences) or (b) sink costs by taking actions such as mobilizing troops that are financially costly ex ante. Analysis of a game model depicting the essentials of each case yields two principal results. First, in the games' equilibria, leaders never bluff with either type of signal; they do not incur or create costs and then fail to respond if challenged. Second, leaders do better on average by tying hands, despite the fact that the ability to do so creates a greater ex ante risk of war than does the use of sunk-cost signals. These results and the logic behind them may help explain some empirical features of international signaling, such as many crises' appearance as competitions in creating domestic political audience costs. They also generate empirical puzzles, such as why the seemingly plausible logic of inference that undermines bluffing in the model does not operate in all empirical cases.},

  Abstract                 = {Realist and other scholars commonly hold that rationally led states can and sometimes do fight when no peaceful bargains exist that both would prefer to war. Against this view, I show that under very broad conditions there will exist negotiated settlements that genuinely rational states would mutually prefer to a risky and costly fight. Popular rationalist and realist explanations for war fail either to address or to explain adequately what would prevent leaders from locating a less costly bargain. Essentially just two mechanisms can resolve this puzzle on strictly rationalist terms. The first turns on the fact that states have both private information about capabilities and resolve and the incentive to misrepresent it. The second turns on the fact that in specific strategic contexts states may be unable credibly to commit to uphold a mutually preferable bargain. Historical examples suggest that both mechanisms are empirically plausible.},

  Abstract                 = {Conventional wisdom holds that in international disputes, a state's military threats are more likely to work the more the state is favored by the balance of power or the balance of interests. Analysis of agame-theoretic model of crisis signaling substantially refines and revises this claim. Due to selection effects arising from strategic behavior, measures of the relative strength of a defender's interests that are available before a crisis begins (ex ante) should be related to the failure of the defender's threats during the crisis. Ex ante measures of the defender's relative military strength should correlate with the success of the defender's crisis threats, but due to strategic dynamics that are not grasped by the standard arguments. A reanalysis of Huth and Russett's dataon immediate deterrent threats lends support for these and other hypotheses drawn from the game-theoretic treatment.},

  Abstract                 = {International crises are modeled as a political "war of attrition" in which state leaders choose at each moment whether to attack, back down, or escalate. A leader who backs down suffers audience costs that increase as the public confrontation proceeds. Equilibrium analysis shows how audience costs enable leaders to learn an adversary's true preferences concerning settlement versus war and thus whether and when attack is rational. The model also generates strong comparative statics results, mainly on the question of which side is most likely to back down. Publicly observable measures of relative military capabilities and relative interests prove to have no direct effect once a crisis begins. Instead, relative audience costs matter: the side with a stronger domestic audience (e.g., a democracy) is always less likely to back down than the side less able to generate audience costs (a nondemocracy). More broadly, the analysis suggests that democracies should be able to signal their intentions to other states more credibly and clearly than authoritarian states can, perhaps ameliorating the security dilemma between democratic states.},

  Abstract                 = {Scholars in comparative politics and international relations routinely evaluate causal hypotheses by referring to counterfactual cases where a hypothesized causal factor is supposed to have been absent. The methodological status and the viability of this very common procedure are unclear and are worth examining. How does the strategy of counterfactual argument relate, if at all, to methods of hypothesis testing based on the comparison of actual cases, such as regression analysis or Mill's Method of Difference? Are counterfactual thought experiments a viable means of assessing hypotheses about national and international outcomes, or are they methodologically invalid in principle? The paper addresses the first question in some detail and begins discussion of the second. Examples from work on the causes of World War I, the nonoccurrence of World War III, social revolutions, the breakdown of democratic regimes in Latin America, and the origins of fascism and corporatism in Europe illustrate the use, problems and potential of counterfactual argument in small-N-oriented political science research.},

  Abstract                 = { ABSTRACT An influential conventional wisdom holds that civil wars proliferated rapidly with the end of the Cold War and that the root cause of many or most of these has been ethnic and religious antagonisms. We show that the current prevalence of internal war is mainly the result of a steady accumulation of protracted conflicts since the 1950s and 1960s rather than a sudden change associated with a new, post-Cold War international system. We also find that after controlling for per capita income, more ethnically or religiously diverse countries have been no more likely to experience significant civil violence in this period. We argue for understanding civil war in this period in terms of insurgency or rural guerrilla warfare, a particular form of military practice that can be harnessed to diverse political agendas. The factors that explain which countries have been at risk for civil war are not their ethnic or religious characteristics but rather the conditions that favor insurgency. These include poverty&mdash;which marks financially and bureaucratically weak states and also favors rebel recruitment&mdash;political instability, rough terrain, and large populations.We wish to thank the many people who provided comments on earlier versions of this paper in a series of seminar presentations.

In typical MMORPGs, players pay a monthly subscription to the game publisher who hosts the game and provides periodic content updates. To be successful, game publishers must characterize their player population so that they can provision sufficient resources to support the game and so that they can update the game in a timely manner. To this end, this paper provides the first, long-term study of a popular MMORPG from its launch. Our dataset encompasses the entire lifetime of "EVE Online" [1, 2], a science-fiction based MMORPG that has supported nearly 1 million unique players, 67 million player sessions, and 17,000 player years of gameplay since its launch in May 2003.},

  Abstract                 = {We investigate the complex relationships between countries in the Eurovision Song Contest, by recasting past voting data in terms of a dynamical network. Despite the British tendency to feel distant from Europe, our analysis shows that the U.K. is remarkably compatible, or 'in tune', with other European countries. Equally surprising is our finding that some other core countries, most notably France, are significantly 'out of tune' with the rest of Europe. In addition, our analysis enables us to confirm a widely-held belief that there are unofficial cliques of countries -- however these cliques are not always the expected ones, nor can their existence be explained solely on the grounds of geographical proximity. The complexity in this system emerges via the group 'self-assessment' process, and in the absence of any central controller. One might therefore speculate that such complexity is representative of many real-world situations in which groups of 'agents' establish their own inter-relationships and hence ultimately decide their own fate. Possible examples include groups of individuals, societies, political groups or even governments.},

The main question addressed is why political events appeared to affect the world's biggest financial market, the London bond market, much less between 1881 and 1914 than they had between 1843 and 1880. In particular, I ask why the outbreak of the First World War, an event traditionally seen as having been heralded by a series of international crises, was not apparently anticipated by investors. The article considers how far the declining sensitivity of the bond market to political events was a result of the spread of the gold standard, increased international financial integration, or changes in the fiscal policies of the great powers. I suggest that the increasing national separation of bond markets offers a better explanation. However, even this structura},

  Abstract                 = {The formal literature on international conflict has identified the combination of uncertainty and the incentive to misrepresent private information as a central cause of war. But there is a fundamental problem with using game-theoretic models to formulate general claims such as theseâwhether and to what extent results derived for a particular game form continue to hold when different mod- eling choices are made is typically unknown. To address this concern, we use techniques from Bayesian mechanism design that allow us to establish general âgame-freeâ results that must hold in any equilibrium of any game form in a broad class of crisis bargaining games. We focus on three different varieties of uncertainty that countries can face and establish general results about the relationship between these sources of uncertainty and the possibility of peaceful resolution of conflict. Among these results, we show that under some condi- tions, there is no equilibrium of any possible crisis bargaining game form that allows the unilateral use of force and completely avoids the chance of costly war.},

  Abstract                 = {Working with the definition of mutual optimism as war due to inconsistent beliefs, we formalize the mutual optimism argument to test the theory's logical validity. We find that in the class of strategic situations where mutual optimism is a necessary condition for war i.e., where war is known to be inefficient, war only occurs if both sides prefer it to a negotiated settlement, and on the eve of conflict war is self-evident then there is no Bayesian-Nash equilibrium where wars are fought because of mutual optimism. The fundamental reason that mutual optimism cannot lead to war is that if both sides are willing to fight, each side should infer that they have either underestimated the strength of the opponent or overestimated their own strength. In either case, these inferences lead to a peaceful settlement of the dispute. We also show that this result extends to situations in which there is bounded rationality and/or noncommon priors.},

  Abstract                 = {Special interests attempt to influence lawmakers through campaign contributions and through informational lobbying. Both avenues have been explored extensively in theoretical models. Only the former, however, has received much empirical scrutiny. We provide the first empirical tests of the major class of models of costly legislative lobbying, the Potters-van Winden-Grossman-Helpman (PWGH) model. To do so, we extend a simple PWGH model to encompass situations in which a legislature adjusts a pre-existing policy only periodically. We then test predictions of the model using data derived from over 50,000 observations of annual lobbying expenditures by special interest groups in the American states. We find that, as predicted, special interest groups 1) increase lobbying expenditures when the legislature is controlled by "enemies" rather than by "friends"; 2) increase lobbying expenditures in budget years in states with biennial budgeting, relative to budget years in states with annual budgeting; and, 3) increasingly exit the lobbying process as lobbying costs rise. Overall, the results provide substantial empirical support for the PWGH class of signaling models of interest group lobbying in legislative settings.},

  Abstract                 = {The goal of supervised learning is to infer a functional mapping based on a set of training examples. To achieve good generalization, it is necessary to control the "complexity" of the learned function. In Bayesian approaches, this is done by adopting a prior for the parameters of the function being learned. We propose a Bayesian approach to supervised learning, which leads to sparse solutions; that is, in which irrelevant parameters are automatically set exactly to zero. Other ways to obtain sparse classifiers (such as Laplacian priors, support vector machines) involve (hyper)parameters which control the degree of sparseness of the resulting classifiers; these parameters have to be somehow adjusted/estimated from the training data. In contrast, our approach does not involve any (hyper)parameters to be adjusted or estimated. This is achieved by a hierarchical-Bayes interpretation of the Laplacian prior, which is then modified by the adoption of a Jeffreys' noninformative hyperprior. Implementation is carried out by an expectationmaximization (EM) algorithm. Experiments with several benchmark data sets show that the proposed approach yields state-of-the-art performance. In particular, our method outperforms SVMs and performs competitively with the best alternative techniques, although it involves no tuning or adjustment of sparseness-controlling hyperparameters.},

  Abstract                 = {Recent research suggests that democracies have advantages and disadvantages in wars. Democracies are more likely to win the wars they initiate and the ones in which they are targeted. Wars initiated by democracies are also uniformly shorter and less costly than wars initiated by nondemocracies. However, democracies are also less likely to continue fighting and less likely to win as war drags on. Democracies are also particularly likely to be targeted. We present a bargaining model that reconciles these divergent findings. The model explains why democracies are more likely to win but are also more likely to settle and more likely to be targeted than other types of regimes. The model's explanation of these facts differs in important ways from existing explanations. The model also suggests several new hypotheses relating regime type to the terms of settlement and the onset of war.},

Our explanations for war termination, however, have tended to rule out the possibility that diplomacy can continue even after the fighting starts and therefore cannot account for negotiated settlements of war. In this article, we develop a model that allows the disputants to negotiate a settlement not only to prevent a war but to terminate it as well. We focus particularly on private information as a key source of conflict and the revelation of that information as a central component of the process of conflict termination. The model generates several novel and interesting hypotheses related to war outcome and war duration. In addition, since the model also includes the decision to begin a war as well as the decision to continue it, the model suggests several hypotheses related to war onset.},

  Abstract                 = {This Paper provides a summary of what is known about trends in international commodity market integration during the second half of the second millennium. The range of goods that have been traded between continents since the Voyages of Discovery has steadily increased over time, and there has been substantial commodity market integration over the period, driven by technology in the 19th century and politics in the late 20th century. This trend towards greater market integration was not, however, monotonic; it was periodically interrupted by shocks such as wars and world depressions, or by endogenous political responses to the distributional effects of globalization itself. In some periods politics has reinforced the effects of technology, while in other periods it has offset them. In several cases, severe shocks have had long-run effects on the international integration of commodity markets, as a result of politically induced hysteresis. Finally, we know remarkably little about international commodity market integration during the 20th century.},

Many conventional assumptions about Islam and politics do not withstand scrutiny. But one factor does help explain the dearth of democracy in the Muslim world: the treatment of women and girls. The rudiments of a provisional theory linking the treatment of females and regime type are offered and the implications of the findings for democracy, both in Muslim societies and elsewhere, are discussed.},

We quantify the effects of tax rates on tax evasion by examining the relationship in China between the tariff schedule and the Ã¢ÂÂevasion gap,Ã¢ÂÂ which we define as the difference between Hong KongÃ¢ÂÂs reported exports to China at the product level and ChinaÃ¢ÂÂs reported imports from Hong Kong. Our results imply that a oneÃ¢ÂÂpercentageÃ¢ÂÂpoint increase in the tax rate is associated with a 3 percent increase in evasion. Furthermore, the evasion gap is negatively correlated with tax rates on closely related products, suggesting that evasion takes place partly through misclassification of imports from higherÃ¢ÂÂtaxed categories to lowerÃ¢ÂÂtaxed ones, in addition to underreporting the value of imports. },

  Abstract                 = {Conventional studies of the late-nineteenth-century international monetary system refer heuristically to "coreâ and "peripheralâ countries. In this article, we seek to provide rigorous foundations to such expressions. Applying a formal procedure borrowed from network analysis produces indices of centrality and systematic rankings. We show that the international monetary system of the late nineteenth century is best described as a three-tier system. Other findings include the discovery of a closely knitted European foreign exchange system, a complete lack of foreign exchange linkages within Latin America, emerging intra-Asian relations, and a fairly late ascendancy of the U.S. dollar.},

The contribution of macroeconomic information to the default premium is also examined. The author finds that holders of low-grade bonds have, on average, been compensated for losses due to default.},

Its practice has evolved significantly in the past ten or fifteen years as it has been used increasingly in civil wars. However, traditional peacekeeping between states is not well understood. Its operation is undertheorized and its effects undertested. This article explores the causal mechanisms through which peacekeepers keep peace and examines its empirical effects after interstate wars. To take the endogeneity of peacekeeping into account, it also examines where peacekeepers tend to be deployed. Duration analysis shows that, all else equal, peacekeeping significantly increases the chances that peace will last. Peacekeepers can help adversaries to maintain peace by making surprise attack more difficult, by reducing uncertainty about enemy intentions, and by preventing and controlling accidents and incidents that can spiral back to war.},

  Abstract                 = {On July 9th and 10th, 2001, the Political Science Program of the National Science Foundation (NSF) convened a Workshop to seek ways to improve technical-analytical proficiency in Political Science by bridging the divide between formal and empirical analysis. The participants in the Workshop were senior scholars with research experience in various technical-analytical areas and proven track records in activities that have improved the technical-analytical expertise in various sciences. They have been editors and have served on editorial boards of leading journals. Participants were primarily from political science, but economics and mathematics were repre- sented as well (see Appendix B).1 Formal analysisÃ¢â¬âor formal modelingÃ¢â¬âincludes, among other things, deductive modeling in a theorem and proof presentation or computational modeling which requires the assistance of simulation. Empirical analysisÃ¢â¬âor empirical modelingÃ¢â¬âusually (but not always) involves data analysis using statistical tools. Both approaches provide significant scientific benefit to political science. At a most basic level, formal modeling assists in the Ã¢â¬Åconstruction of valid arguments such that the fact or facts to be explained can be derived from the premises that constitute the explanation.Ã¢â¬ï¿½2 In contrast, empirical modeling shows the researcher where their model went wrong and leaves open the possibility that a more accurate model can be constructed. A schism has developed between those who engage in formal modeling that is highly mathematical, and those who employ empirical modeling which emphasizes applied statistics. As a consequence, a good deal of research in political science is competent in one technical area, but lacking in another, that is, a formal approach with substandard (or no) empirical tests or an empirical approach without formal clarity. Such impaired competency contributes to a failure to identify the proximate causes explicated in a theory and, in turn, increases the difficulty of achieving a meaningful increase in scientific knowledge. If one were to summarize in one word what bridging the divide between formal and empirical modeling means for the political and social sciences, that word would be identification. The ability of a researcher to identify or parse out specific causal linkages among the many factors is fundamental to the scientific enterprise. Specifying a model that links both formal and empirical approaches alerts researchers to outcomes when specific conditions are in placeÃ¢â¬âand is also one of the best ways to determine an identified relationship. The Empirical Implications of Theoretical Models (hereafter EITM) Workshop was conducted to suggest constructive approaches that the Political Science Program at the NSF could employ to foster identification in formal and empirical modeling. To these ends, EITM Workshop participants were asked to provide, prior to the workshop, a short commentary on the following issues: Consider the factors contributing to the split between formal theory and empirical modeling. (This included the current status of the American, Comparative, International Relations, and Methods/Formal fields and subfields as well as other disciplines). Discuss the need to bridge formal theory and empirical modeling and viable strategies for doing so in the discipline. Discuss interdisciplinary avenues and extensions, which include academic and non-academic examples. These might include the work at academic institutions such as California Institute of Technology, and Carnegie- Mellon, and at non-academic institutions such as The Brookings Institution and The Santa Fe Institute. Explore the role that NSF funding opportunities can play to advance the linkage of formal modeling and empirical modeling. What has proven effective in the past? Are there best practices in other disciplines? Develop a coherent strategy for implementing the initiatives via a Ã¢â¬ÅDear ColleagueÃ¢â¬ï¿½ letter from the NSF to the political science community. Modes of implementation might include: i) Infrastructure opportunities. ii) Annual meetings. iii) Graduate and/or undergraduate student opportunities. iv) Junior and senior faculty opportunities. v) Inter/multidisciplinary opportunities. vi) Other considerations.},

  Abstract                 = {Previous studies have found that both political orientations (Alford, Funk and Hibbing 2005) and voting behavior (Fowler, Baker and Dawes 2008; Fowler and Dawes 2008) are significantly heritable. In this article we study genetic variation in another important political behavior: partisan attachment. Using the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health, we show that individuals with the A2 allele of the D2 dopamine receptor gene are significantly more likely to identify as a partisan than those with the A1 allele. Further, we find that this geneâs association with partisanship also mediates an indirect association between the A2 allele and voter turnout. These results are the first to identify a specific gene that may be partly responsible for the tendency to join political groups, and they may help to explain correlation in parent and child partisanship and the persistence of partisan behavior over time.},

  Abstract                 = {We construct the complete network of 30,288 majority opinions written by the U.S. Supreme Court andthe cases they cite from 1754 to 2002. Data from this network demonstrates quantitatively the evolution of the norm of stare decisis in the 19th Century and a significant deviation from this norm by the activistWarren court. We further describe a method for creating authority scores using the network data toidentify the most important Court precedents. This method yields rankings that conform closely to evaluations by legal experts, and even predicts which cases they will identify as important in the future. An analysis of these scores over time allows us to test several hypotheses about the rise and fall of precedent. We show that reversed cases tend to be much more important than other decisions, and thecases that overrule them quickly become and remain even more important as the reversed decisionsdecline. We also show that the Court is careful to ground overruling decisions in past precedent, and thecare it exercises is increasing in the importance of the decision that is overruled. Finally, authority scorescorroborate qualitative assessments of which issues and cases the Court prioritizes and how these changeover time.},

The data show that there are longer delays in distributing benefits and a more egalitarian distribution of benefits under the open amendment rule, the proposer gets a larger share of the benefits than coalition members under both rules, and play converges toward minimal winning coalitions under the closed amendment rule. However, there are important quantitative differences between the theoretical model underlying the experiment (Baron and Ferejohn 1989) and data, as the frequency of minimal winning coalitions is much greater under the closed rule (the theory predicts minimal winning coalitions under both rules for our parameter values) and the distribution of benefits between coalition members is much more egalitarian than predicted. The latter are consistent with findings from shrinking pie bilateral bargaining game experiments in economics, to which we relate our results.},

We experimentally investigate a recent model in which legislators allocate a fixed budget between collective public goods and particularistic goods. Our results confirm many aspects of the model. In particular when legislators value of collective goods is relatively low the budget is almost exclusively allocated to particularistic goods within a minimum winning coalition. However, in the "mixed region" in which both collective goods and particularistic goods are provided, the share of the budget devoted to the public good decreases as the relative value of the public good decreases, which is inconsistent with the stationary subgame perfect equilibrium prediction of the model but can be rationalized given how subjects voted.},

  Abstract                 = {Since the mid-1980s a substantial body of research has taken shape on trade in services. Much of this is inspired by the WTO or regional trade agreements, especially the EU. However, an increasing number of papers focus on the impacts of unilateral services sector liberalization. The literature touches on important linkages between trade and FDI in services and the general pattern of productivity growth and industrial development. This paper surveys the literature on services trade, focusing on contributions that investigate the determinants of international trade and investment in services, the potential gains from greater trade (and liberalization) and efforts to cooperate to achieve such liberalization through trade agreements. There is increasing evidence that services liberalization is a major potential source of welfare gains, and that the performance of service sectors, and thus services policies, may be an important determinant of trade volumes, the distributional effects of trade, and economy-wide growth. At the same time, they are also an important source of increasing political unease about the impacts of globalization on labor markets.},

  Abstract                 = {We have argued and shown elsewhere the ubiquity and prominence of spatial interdependence, i.e., interdependence of outcomes among cross-sectional units, across the theories and substance of political and social science, and we have noted that much previous practice neglected this interdependence or treated it solely as nuisance, to the serious detriment of sound inference. These earlier studies considered only linear- regression models of spatial/spatio-temporal interdependence. For those classes of models, we (1) derived analytically in simple cases the biases of non-spatial and spatial least-squares (LS) under interdependence, (2) explored in simulations under richer, more realistic circumstances the properties of the biased non-spatial and spatial least-squares estimators and of the consistent and asymptotically efficient spatial method-of-moments (i.e., IV, 2SLS, GMM) and spatial maximum-likelihood estimators (ML), and (3) showed how to calculate, interpret, and present effectively the estimated spatial/spatio-temporal effects and dynamics of such models, along with appropriate standard errors, confidence intervals, hypothesis tests, etc. This paper begins a like set of tasks for binary-outcome models. We start again by stressing the ubiquity and centrality substantively and theoretically of interdependence in binary outcomes of interest to political and social scientists. We note that, again, this interdependence has typically been ignored in most contexts where it likely arises and that, in the few contexts where it has been acknowledged, or even rather centrally emphasized, those of policy diffusion and of social networks, the endogeneity of the spatial lag used (appropriately) to model the interdependence has only rarely been recognized. Next, we note and explain some of the severe challenges for empirical analysis posed by spatial interdependence in binary-outcome models, and then we follow recent advances in the spatial-econometric literature to suggest Bayesian or recursive-importance-sampling (RIS) approaches for tackling the estimation demands of these models. In brief and in general, the estimation complications arise because among the RHS variables is an endogenous weighted spatial-lag of the unobserved latent outcome, y*, in the other units; Bayesian or RIS techniques facilitate the complicated nested optimization exercise that follows from that fact. We show how to calculate estimated spatial effects (as opposed to parameter estimates) in such models and how to construct confidence regions for those, adopting simulation strategies for these purposes, and then how to present such estimates effectively.},

We explore the inferential benefits and methodological challenges of directly modeling international diffusion, one form of spatial dependence. To this end, we first identify two substantive classes of modern comparative-and-international-political-economy (C&IPE) theoretical modelsâ(context-conditional) open-economy comparative political-economy (CPE) models and international political-economy (IPE) models, which imply diffusion (along with predecessors, closed-economy CPE and orthogonal open-economy CPE)âand then we evaluate the relative performance of three estimatorsânon-spatial OLS, spatial OLS, and spatial 2SLSâfor analyzing empirical models corresponding to these two modern alternative theoretical visions from spatially interdependent data. Finally, we offer a substantive application of the spatial 2SLS approach in what we call a spatial error-correction model of international tax competition.},

  Abstract                 = {Starting from a number of deficiencies in the Comparative Manifestos Project approach to studying left-right policy scales in election programs, an additive model based on the distinction between position and valence issues is proposed. This allows analysis of the policy space in established democracies under the assumption that left and right have different meanings from country to country and over time. The model is illustrated with regard to four Western European countries with different types of party system: Germany, Italy, Sweden and the United Kingdom. Empirical findings affirm that the procedures are workable and that the data generated are capable of yielding detailed information beyond that which previous approaches are able to deliver. In addition, preliminary tests on external validity produce reassuring results.},

Failure stories are also discussed, and comparisons may provide some insight. In particular, this paper suggests that statistical technique can seldom be an adequate substitute for good design, relevant data, and testing predictions against reality in a variety of settings.},

The intention is to have a procedure for sampling and comparing qualitative information that national security analysts possess that cannot otherwise be directly inserted into a model specification. Updating network connectivity is an interesting question unto itself, but the application to political actors adds challenging and fascinating complexities since information is not only qualitative but often expressed in different terms and contexts. We have a basic software module freely available to researchers (provided no commercial use). Despite the difficulties listed, prior information in a Bayesian context is an ideal means of obtaining and describing levels of uncertainty that analysts possess. The working paper can be accessed},

  Abstract                 = {The relationships between the workings of democratic institutions and currency markets are studied. Several competing propositions about how political (re)equilibration affects currency markets are derived and tested. The results support the view that democratic politics affects currency markets. Expectations and uncertainty about electoral outcomes and government survival affect the probability of switching between currency-market equilibria. Additionally, opinion polls about chief executive performance have a direct effect on the probabilities of switches between currency regimes suggesting that these polls cause currency traders to revise their expectations about the stability of governments and (or) the contents of public policies. Electoral institutions mitigate the impact of politics on currency-market equilibria. Political effects are weaker in countries with proportional representation electoral systems than in countries with majority-plurality systems. There is less evidence that central-bank independence, consensual-corporatist systems, or "political coherency" reduces the effect of politics on currency markets.},

Alternative definitions of forecasting are contradictory; programs for developing scientific forecasts of international phenomena fail to acknowledge important epistemological difficulties. Forecasting and prediction are distinguished, and several illustrations of each type of activity are presented. Criteria for determining the soundness of scientific forecasts then are offered, and the prospects for constructing sound international relations forecasts are assessed. The primary conclusion is that individual-level generalizations of events like crises have the greatest potential in this regard. Forecasts of systems-transformation, in contrast, will never be scientifically sound; generalizations of this kind offer the least potential for developing scientifically meaningful forecasts.},

It revises and extends that analysis in a number of ways: (1) It more accurately fits the model parameters using linear regression; (2) it considers the data from the entire campaign; and (3) it adds in air sortie data. In contrast to previous results, it concludes by showing that neither the Lanchester linear or Lanchester square laws fit the data.

  Abstract                 = {The graphic portrayal of quantitative information has deep roots. These roots reach into histories of thematic cartography, statistical graphics, and data visualization, which are intertwined with each other. They also connect with the rise of statistical thinking up through the 19th century, and developments in technology into the 20th century. From above ground, we can see the current fruit; we must look below to see its pedigree and germination. There certainly have been many new things in the world of visualization; but unless you know its history, everything might seem novel.},

In a PBE, (P) the strategies form a Bayesian equilibrium for each continuation game, given the specified beliefs, and (B) beliefs are updated from period to period in accordance with Bayes rule whenever possible, and satisfy a "no-signaling-what-you-don't-know" condition. PBE is equivalent to sequential equilibrium if each player has only two types, or there are only two periods, but differs otherwise. Equivalence is restored by requiring that (B) apply to the relative probabilities of types with posterior probability zero.},

He examines the formidable obstacles facing the liberal evolution of political Islam. He observes that several regimes are embracing harsh social and intellectual interpretations of Islam so as to bolster their credentials against Islamist opposition.

We argue that it is important to distinguish between the different levels of interaction opportunities open to contiguous states and propose to operationalize this as the length of the shared land boundary. Data on boundary lengths can be used, e.g., in the study of the relationship between natural resources and conflict or in the study of the diffusion of conflict. To date, such datasets have only been available for the most recent years.

  Abstract                 = {International conflict has been analyzed extensive v through the framework of opportunity and willingness. Opportunity has mainly been operationalized as physical proximity. Willingness has been measured in a number of ways, and remains a somewhat more elusive concept. Several scholars have called for boundary length to represent opportunity. Heeding such calls, Harvey Starr has used GIS methods to generate boundary length for 1993 and has found it to be associated with increased propensity to conflict. A number of his measures of willingness were not. Using a new and much more extensive dataset on boundary length for the entire Correlates of War period, this article finds very different results. We study the relationship with shared rivers and water scarcity as measures of neomalthusian factors in willingness over a 110-year period indicate that the neomalhusian factors are significant although not dramatic in their effects. Boundary length, while associated with conflict in a bivariate analysis, fades into insignificance when the neomalthusian willingness measures are introduced.},

  Abstract                 = {The left-right ideological positions of political parties play a central role in theorizing about many different aspects of democratic processes. Unfortunately, scholars are hindered in their ability to test existing theories by the limited availability of data that is comparable over time and across countries. This paper describes a simple 'vanilla' method for using manifestos data to estimate party left-right positions. It then tests this method and four existing ones by regressing a variety of accepted survey-based measures of left-right party positions on the estimates of party positions generated by the various techniques. Finally, analysis of the residuals from these regressions identifies the extent to which there are systematic sources of errors in using manifestos data to estimate party left-right positions. The vanilla method consistently produces the best estimates of party positions, and these estimates are quite good (less than one point, on average, from the estimates of other accepted approaches). Manifestos data, however, tend to locate extreme parties closer to the ideological center than do other survey-based approaches.},

  Abstract                 = {This article examines a legislature's delegation of policy-making authority to an imperfectly controlled, expert bureaucrat. The legislature can reduce the bureaucrat's expertise advantage through costly investigations of its own before delegating. Further, the bureaucrat is granted discretionary bounds by the legislature, but can subvert legislative dictates by stepping beyond them at some cost. I analyze the interaction of preference divergence, investigation cost to the legislature, and subversion cost to the bureaucrat on the decision to delegate. The model shows that, because of the equilibrium effect of subversion on discretion, bureaucrats will want subversion of legislative dictates to be difficult, while legislators want it to be relatively easy. It also highlights an indirect effect between preference divergence and discretion: preference divergence leads the legislature to become more expert on policy matters, which leads it to delegate less.},

  Abstract                 = {We extend the standard model of social learning in two ways. First, we introduce a social network and assume that agents can only observe the actions of agents to whom they are connected by this network. Secondly, we allow agents to choose a different action at each date. If the network satisfies a connectedness assumption, the initial diversity resulting from diverse private information is eventually replaced by uniformity of actions, though not necessarily of beliefs, in finite time with probability one. We look at particular networks to illustrate the impact of network architecture on speed of convergence and the optimality of absorbing states. Convergence is remarkably rapid, so that asymptotic results are a good approximation even in the medium run.},

  Abstract                 = {In this chapter, we review the recent literature on conflict and appropriation. Allowing for the possibility of conflict, which amounts to recognizing the possibility that property rights are not perfectly and costlessly enforced, represents a significant departure from the traditional paradigm of economics. The research we emphasize, however, takes an economic perspective. Specifically, it applies conventional optimization techniques and game-theoretic tools to study the allocation of resources among competing activities â productive and otherwise appropriative, such as grabbing the product and wealth of others as well as defending one's own product and wealth. In contrast to other economic activities in which inputs are combined cooperatively through production functions, the inputs to appropriation are combined adversarially through technologies of conflict. A central objective of this research is to identify the effects of conflict on economic outcomes: the determinants of the distribution of output (or power) and how an individual party's share can be inversely related to its marginal productivity; when settlement in the shadow of conflict and when open conflict can be expected to occur, with longer time horizons capable of inducing conflict instead of settlement; how conflict and appropriation can reduce the appeal of trade; the determinants of alliance formation and the importance of intra-alliance commitments; how dynamic incentives for capital accumulation and innovation are distorted in the presence of conflict; and the role of governance in conflict management.},

  Abstract                 = {How do military organizations assess strategic policy in war? In this book Scott Gartner develops a theory to explain how military and government leaders evaluate wartime performance, how much they change strategies in response to this evaluation, and why they are frequently at odds when discussing the success or failure of strategic performance. Blending history, decision theory, and mathematical modeling, Gartner argues that military personnel do reevaluate their strategies and that they measure the performance of a strategy through quantitative, "dominant" indicators. But different actors within a government use different indicators of success: some will see the strategy as succeeding when others see it as failing because of their different dominant indicators. Gartner tests his argument with three case studies: the British shift to convoys in World War I following the German imposition of unrestricted submarine warfare; the lack of change in British naval policy in the Battle of the Atlantic following the German introduction of Wolf Packs in World War II; and the American decision to deescalate in Vietnam after the Tet Offensive. He also tests his approach in a nonwar situation, analyzing the Carter Administration's decision to launch the hostage rescue attempt. In each case, his dominant indicator model better predicts the observed behavior than either a standard-organization or an action-reaction approach.},

  Abstract                 = {The wartime roles of race and public opinion represent contested issues in the growing literature on war and domestic politics, especially in studies of the Vietnam War. We develop a Ã¢ÂÂmodified sociotropicÃ¢ÂÂ approach that allows us to examine three sets of propositions about the influence of race on individual opinion of the Vietnam War. (1) The race of citizens affects their opinion. (2) The race of respondents influences their sensitivity to casualties. (3) A citizen is more sensitive to casualties from his or her own racial group and less sensitive to casualties of other groups. We test these propositions with data from eight pooled surveys of 6,300 Californians during the Vietnam War and racially disaggregated proximate wartime casualties. We find that African-Americans do not differ significantly from whites in their approval early on, but are significantly less likely to support the war in the latter stages. However, both whites and blacks largely react similarly to proximate casualties, whether or not they share racial traits with the casualties. People's attitudes are influenced by the number of people that die in their locality, but neither the race of the respondent nor the combination of the respondent's race and that of the local casualties significantly modifies that relationship.},

The authors argue that temporally proximate costs, captured as marginal casualty figures, are an important additional aspect of human costs and a critical factor in determining wartime opinion. Using Mueller's data on opinion in the Vietnam and Korean wars, the authors find that marginal casualties are important in explaining opinion when casualty accumulation is accelerating, and earlier findings about the importance and generalizability of the log of cumulative casualties as the sole casualty-based predictor of opinion are overstated. Finally, the authors offer some thoughts about other factors that should be considered when building a model of war deaths and domestic opinion.},

  Abstract                 = {Immanuel Kant and more recent expositors of the democratic peace thesis suggest that citizens in a republic sanction leaders for resorting to war because, in part, citizens are loath to shed their own blood. This Kantian thesis in turn implies substitution. Just as consumers confronted with price shocks shift consumption to less affected goods rather than simply curtailing consumption, democratic leaders facing retribution for casualties can limit losses, not just by avoiding military contests, but also by substituting capital (ships, tanks, aircraft) for labor (soldiers, sailors, airmen) in the provision of security. A simple consumer choice model shows that citizens' leverage over leaders implies that democracies should consume disproportionately more capital in preparing for-and conducting-defense. Numerous anecdotes assert that democracies do shelter labor with capital, especially during war, but tests of defense-factor allocations on factor endowments, regime-type, and other variables show that defense-factor usage is explained by basic economic theory and not by democracy.},

  Abstract                 = {A debate exists over whether (and to what degree) the democratic peace is explained by joint democracy or by a lack of motives for conflict between states that happen to be democratic. Gartzke (1998) applies expected utility theory to the democratic peace and shows that an index of states' preference similarity based on United Nations General Assembly roll-call votes (AFFINITY) accounts for much of the lack of militarized interstate disputes (MIDs) between democracies. Oneal and Russett (1997b, 1998, 1999) respond by arguing that UN voting is itself a function of regime type-that democracy "causes" AFFINITY. Oneal and Russett seek to demonstrate their thesis by regressing AFFINITY. On democracy and other variables from a standard model of the democratic peace. I replicate results reported by Oneal and Russett and then extend the analysis in several ways. I find that the residuals from Oneal and Russett's regression of AFFINITY remain highly significant as a predictor of the absence of MIDs, Further, significance for democracy is shown to be fragile and subject to variable construction, model specification, and the choice of estimation procedure.},

For states, it follows, war must appear as a random event. By implication, factors that cannot be observed by states typically cannot be observed by analysts. If analysts can distinguish states that are willing and able to fight from those that are not, even ex post, then states will be able to distinguish among such states as well, ex post, and will internalize this information in their decisions. To observers, then, the causes of war must always be in the "error term." I discuss the argument, its relationship to the literature, and implications for applied and theoretical research.},

If instead democracies are much less likely to disagree about each other's policies, then we would expect them to seldom fight regardless of whether they are constrained from acting on conflicts by institutions, culture, or other factors. While previous research on the democratic peace has been careful to construct statistical models of "opportunity" - the physical obstacles nations face in engaging in war - research to date has failed to incorporate "willingness" - the psychological incentives nations have to overcome obstacles in pursuit of their objectives. Hypothesis: I argue that a satisfactory assessment of the democratic peace requires controlling for willingness as well as opportunity. A measure of the affinity nations have for each other's international policy should correlate with observations of the democratic peace. Methods: I present a statistical model of national preference using data from the United Nations General Assembly 1950-85 to assess whether joint democracy still accounts for the democratic peace. I test the model using logistic regression and by replicating recent quantitative studies of the democratic peace. Results: Results support the argument that national preferences account for the lack of conflict between democracies.},

To the degree that globalization forces leaders to choose between pursuing competitive political goals and maintaining economic stability, it reveals the intensity of leaders' preferences, reducing the need for military contests as a method of identifying mutually acceptable bargains. Asymmetric integration can dampen the pacific effects of globalization, but asymmetry does not in itself exacerbate dispute behavior. We present the theory and offer preliminary corroborative tests of implications of the argument on postwar militarized disputes.},

Still, existing understanding of linkages betweenconflict and international economics is limited in at least two ways.First, cross-border economic relationships are far broader than justtrade. Global capital markets dwarf the exchange of goods and services,and states engage in varying degrees of monetary policy coordination.Second, the manner in which economics is said to inhibit conflictbehavior is implausible in light of new analytical insights about thecauses of war. We discuss, and then demonstrate formally, howinterdependence can influence states&apos; recourse to military violence. Therisk of disrupting economic linkages&mdash;particularly access tocapital&mdash;mayoccasionally deter minor contests between interdependent states, butsuch opportunity costs will typically fail to preclude militarizeddisputes. Instead, interdependence offers nonmilitarized avenues forcommunicating resolve through costly signaling. Our quantitative resultsshow that capital interdependence contributes to peace independent ofthe effects of trade, democracy, interest, and other variables. },

  Abstract                 = {Distributed lag non-linear models (DLNMs) represent a modeling framework to flexibly describe associations showing potentially non-linear and delayed effects in time series data. This methodology rests on the definition of a crossbasis, a bi-dimensional functional space expressed by the combination of two sets of basis functions, which specify the relationships in the dimensions of predictor and lags, respectively. This framework is implemented in the R package dlnm, which provides functions to perform the broad range of models within the DLNM family and then to help interpret the results, with an emphasis on graphical representation. This paper offers an overview of the capabilities of the package, describing the conceptual and practical steps to specify and interpret DLNMs with an example of application to real data.},

  Abstract                 = {Environmental stressors often show effects that are delayed in time, requiring the use of statistical models that are flexible enough to describe the additional time dimension of the exposureâresponse relationship. Here we develop the family of distributed lag non-linear models (DLNM), a modelling framework that can simultaneously represent non-linear exposureâresponse dependencies and delayed effects. This methodology is based on the definition of a âcross-basisâ, a bi-dimensional space of functions that describes simultaneously the shape of the relationship along both the space of the predictor and the lag dimension of its occurrence. In this way the approach provides a unified framework for a range of models that have previously been used in this setting, and new more flexible variants. This family of models is implemented in the package dlnm within the statistical environment R. To illustrate the methodology we use examples of DLNMs to represent the relationship between temperature and mortality, using data from the National Morbidity, Mortality, and Air Pollution Study (NMMAPS) for New York during the period 1987â2000.

  Abstract                 = {The Nordic development assistance programs have earned a reputation for commitment to human rights and democracy. Is the reputation deserved? We address this question by comparing how much aid donors give and to which recipient countries. Using a global panel data set, spanning the period 1980- 99 and 91 recipient countries, we find that individual bilateral donors vary considerably from one another. Nordic aid distribution differs significantly from other bilateral aid donor patterns: Norway, Denmark, Sweden and Finland provide more aid to democracies but do not penalise poor trade policies. Unlike other bilateral donors the four Nordics do not provide more aid to political allies. We also find some evidence that recipients with a good human rights record receive more aid from Nordic donors.},

Strong evidence supports the claims that democracy is more likely in more developed countries and that regime transitions of all kinds are more likely during economic downturns. Very few of the other arguments advanced in the transitions literature, however, appear to be generally true. This study proposes a theoretical model, rooted in characteristics of different types of authoritarian regimes, to explain many of the differences in democratization experience across cases in different regions. Evidence drawn from a data set that includes 163 authoritarian regimes offers preliminary support for the model proposed. },

  Abstract                 = {We present a formal model of government control of the media to illuminate variation in media freedom across countries and over time, with particular application to less democratic states. The extent of media freedom depends critically on two variables: the mobilizing character of the government and the size of the advertising market. Media bias is greater and state ownership of the media more likely when the need for social mobilization is large; however, the distinction between state and private media is smaller. Large advertising markets reduce media bias in both state and private media, but increase the incentive for the government to nationalize private media. We illustrate these arguments with a case study of media freedom in postcommunist Russia, where media bias has responded to the mobilizing needs of the Kremlin and government control over the media has grown in tandem with the size of the advertising market.},

The resulting coefficients are then directly comparable for untransformed binary predictors. We have implemented the procedure as a function in R. We illustrate the method with two simple analyses that are typical of applied regression. We recommend our rescaling as a default optionÃâan improvement upon the usual approach of including variables in whatever way they are coded in the data fileÃâso that the magnitudes of coefficients can be directly compared as a matter of routine statistical practice.},

In this paper, we present a Bayesian framework for EDA based on posterior predictive checks. We explain how posterior predictive simulations can be used to create reference distributions for EDA graphs, and how this approach resolves some theoretical problems in Bayesian data analysis. We show how the generalization of Bayesian inference to include replicated data yrep and replicated parameters 03B8rep follows a long tradition of generalizations in Bayesian theory. On the theoretical level, we present a predictive Bayesian formulation of goodness-of-fit testing, distinguishing between p-values (posterior probabilities that specified antisymmetric discrepancy measures will exceed 0) and u-values (data summaries with uniform sampling distributions). We explain that p-values, unlike u-values, are Bayesian probability statements in that they condition on observed data. Having reviewed the general theoretical framework, we discuss the implications for statistical graphics and exploratory data analysis, with the goal being to unify exploratory data analysis with more formal statistical methods based on probability models. We interpret various graphical displays as posterior predictive checks and discuss how Bayesian inference can be used to determine reference distributions. The goal of this work is not to downgrade descriptive statistics, or to suggest they be replaced by Bayesian modeling, but rather to suggest how exploratory data analysis fits into the probability-modeling paradigm. We conclude with a discussion of the implications for practical Bayesian inference. In particular, we anticipate that Bayesian software can be generalized to draw simulations of replicated data and parameters from their posterior predictive distribution, and these can in turn be used to calibrate EDA graphs.},

  Abstract                 = {In a predictive model, what is the expected difference in the outcome associated with a unit difference in one of the inputs? In a linear regression model without interactions, this average predictive comparison is simply a regression coefficient (with associated uncertainty). In a model with nonlinearity or interactions, however, the average predictive comparison in general depends on the values of the predictors. We consider various definitions based on averages over a population distribution of the predictors, and we compute standard errors based on uncertainty in model parameters. We illustrate with a study of criminal justice data for urban counties in the United States. The outcome of interest measures whether a convicted felon received a prison sentence rather than a jail or non-custodial sentence, with predictors available at both individual and county levels. We fit three models: (1) a hierarchical logistic regression with varying coefficients for the within-county intercepts as well as for each individual predictor; (2) a hierarchical model with varying intercepts only; and (3) a nonhierarchical model that ignores the multilevel nature of the data. The regression coefficients have different interpretations for the different models; in contrast, the models can be compared directly using predictive comparisons. Furthermore, predictive comparisons clarify the interplay between the individual and county predictors for the hierarchical models and also illustrate the relative size of varying county effects.},

A simple theoretical analysis shows this comparison performs reasonably well, with 80\%--90\% efficiency compared to the linear regression if the predictor is uniformly or normally distributed. Discretizing x into three categories claws back about half the efficiency lost by the commonly-used strategy of dichotomizing the predictor. We illustrate with the example that motivated this research: an analysis of income and voting which we had originally performed for a scholarly journal but then wanted to communicate to a general audience.},

  Abstract                 = {It is common to summarize statistical comparisons by declarations of statistical significance or nonsignificance. Here we discuss one problem with such declarations, namely that changes in statistical significance are often not themselves statistically significant. By this, we are not merely making the commonplace observation that any particular threshold is arbitrary --- for example, only a small change is required to move an estimate from significance. Rather, we are pointing out that even large changesde- in significance levels can correspond to small, nonsignificant changes in the underlying quantities. The error we describe is conceptually different from other oft-cited problemsâthat statistical significance is not the same as practical importance, that dichotomization into significant and nonsignificant results encourages the dismissal of observed dif- ferences in favor of the usually less interesting null hypothesis of no difference, and that any particular threshold for declaring significance is arbitrary. We are troubled by all of these concerns and do not intend to minimize their importance. Rather, our goal is to bring attention to this additional error of interpretation. We illustrate with a theoretical example and two applied examples. The ubiquity of this statistical error leads us to suggest that stu- dents and practitioners be made more aware that the difference between "significantâ and "not significantâ is not itself statistically significant.},

We apply the measure to study the market forces that determine political con- tent in the news. We estimate a model of newspaper demand that incorporates slant explicitly, estimate the slant that would be chosen if newspapers independently maximized their own profits, and compare these ideal points with .rms. actual choices. Our analysis confirms an economically significant demand for news slanted toward one's own political ideology. Firms respond strongly to consumer preferences, which account for roughly 20 percent of the variation in measured slant in our sample. By contrast, the identity of a newspaper's owner explains far less of the variation in slant. We also present evidence on the role of pressure from incumbent politicians, tastes of reporters, and newspaper competition in determining slant.},

A variety of substantive messages were used. Voter turnout was increased substantially by personal canvassing, slightly by direct mail, and not at all by telephone calls. These findings support our hypothesis that the long-term retrenchment in voter turnout is partly attributable to the decline in face-to-face political mobilization.},

  Abstract                 = {This codebook refers to the variables that are in the dyadic MID data set created as part of the MID 3.0 project, for the years 1993-2001 (see note below on time coverage). Dyadic MIDs break down the overall MIDs, some of which have many participants, into actual disputing pairs of states. Each dyadic MID has exactly two states involved, on opposite sides of the MID. Each of these two states was directly involved in militarized incidents against the other, and either (or both) took direct actions toward the other state or from it. The data set omits dyads where the two states were on opposite sides of a multi-party dispute, but never took action towards one another. In addition, where a state exits and reenters a MID after a substantial period of time, there is a new dyadic MID, While there are approximately 300 MIDs from 1993-2001, there are over 500 dyadic MIDs during this period. Because dyadic MIDs are generated from the incident-level data, the COW projectÃâÃ¢â¬â¢s dyadic MID set is generally restricted to the years 1993-2001. Additionally, dyadic MID data is provided for MIDs that were ongoing as of 12/31/1992, as incident-level information was gathered for those MIDs.},

  Abstract                 = {This paper studies empirically the effects and the interactions of economic and political liberalizations. Economic liberalizations are measured as reforms that increase the scope of the market. Political liberalizations correspond to the event of becoming a democracy. Using difference-in-difference estimation, we study the effects on economic performance, macroeconomic policy and structural policies. Our main contribution is the analysis of the joint effects of both liberalizations, and the finding that the sequence of reforms matters. Countries that first liberalize the economy and then become democracies do much better than countries that pursue the opposite sequence, in almost all dimensions.},

  Abstract                 = {It is commonly thought that there is a trade-off between the breadth and depth of multilateral institutions-that is, multilaterals that are more inclusive in their memberships will necessarily be shallower in their level of cooperation. Using a multilateral bargaining model with self-seeking rational actors, I show that such a trade-off does not exist for a broad class of multilateral cooperation problems. The conclusion that there is a broader-deeper trade-off follows from the assumption that the members of the multilateral must set their policies at an identical level. The multilateral agreement modeled in this article allows states to set their policies at different levels. Once this change is made, there is no broader-deeper trade-off, a finding that has obvious empirical and policy implications. It explains why some regimes are created with fairly large memberships at the outset, and it calls into question the policy prescription of limiting membership of multilateral institutions to a small group of committed cooperators for the class of cooperation problems modeled in this article.},

  Abstract                 = {The negotiations of multilateral agreements are often long and laborious endeavors, but international relations scholars know very little about what occurs during the bargaining of such agreements, and systematic empirical work is seriously lacking. Little empirical work on how multilateral agreements are negotiated exists because data on the negotiations of a large number of agreements across multiple issue areas has not been collected. The purpose of this paper is to introduce a new database of facts related to the multilateral agreement making process. The dataset includes data on what occurred during the negotiations of 170 multilateral agreements, across several different issue areas. Research design and case selection are discussed, as well as the coding of three variables unique to the dataset: the length of negotiations, the first proposal maker, and the number of negotiating states. Descriptive statistics on these variables are also provided.},

  Abstract                 = {Theory: Unconventional political behavior that address racial or ethnic minority con- cerns are most effective at obtaining a response from the Supreme Court when these external pressures are followed by race relations encompassing a greater part of the overall public agenda. Hypothesis: By examining how often minority cases arrive at the Supreme Court as well as the courts willingness to offer favorable decisions, I test the theory that is presented. Expectations are that the court will both increase the number of minority cases and favorable rulings to minority cases, when presented with public appeals to address minority concerns. In addition, I expect that liberal justices will be more susceptible to these external pressures than conservative justices. Methods: I employ an AR(1) model on data drawn from the the U.S Supreme Court data base (Spaeth 1999). Results: External pressures, as seen by the interaction of political behavior and public opinion are able to garner a response from the Supreme Court. The findings show that unconventional political behavior in and of itself can influence the number of cases that arrive to the court, but this behavior has to mobilize public opinion in order to positively influence the decisions of the court. This framework applies to both liberal and conservative justices.},

  Abstract                 = { Time series subject to parameter shifts of random magnitude and timing are commonly modeled with a change-point approach using Chib's algorithm to draw the break dates. We outline some advantages of an alternative approach in which breaks come through mixture distributions in state innovations, and for which the sampler of Gerlach, Carter, and Kohn allows reliable and efficient inference. We show how the same sampler can be used to model shifts in variance that occur independently of shifts in other parameters and how to draw the break dates efficiently when regime durations follow a Poisson process. Finally, we introduce to the time series literature the concept of adaptive Metropolis--Hastings sampling for discrete latent variable models. We develop an easily implemented adaptive algorithm that improves on the work of Gerlach et al. and promises to significantly reduce computing time in a variety of problems including mixture innovation, change-point, regime switching, and outlier detection.

  Abstract                 = {A number of recent studies have focused on the statistical properties of networked systems such as social networks and the World-Wide Web. Researchers have concentrated particularly on a few properties which seem to be common to many networks: the small-world property, power-law degree distributions, and network transitivity. In this paper, we highlight another property which is found in many networks, the property of community structure, in which network nodes are joined together in tightly-knit groups between which there are only looser connections. We propose a new method for detecting such communities, built around the idea of using centrality indices to find community boundaries. We test our method on computer generated and real-world graphs whose community structure is already known, and find that it detects this known structure with high sensitivity and reliability. We also apply the method to two networks whose community structure is not well-known - a collaboration network and a food web - and find that it detects significant and informative community divisions in both cases.},

  Abstract                 = {Although research on conflict has tended to separately study interstate conflict and civil war, states experiencing civil wars are substantially more likely to become involved in militarized disputes with other states. Scholars have typically focused on opportunistic attacks or diversionary wars to explain this domesticâinternational conflict nexus. The authors argue that international disputes that coincide with civil wars are more often directly tied to the issues surrounding the civil war and emphasize intervention, externalization, and unintended spillover effects from internal conflict as important sources of international friction. They empirically demonstrate that civil wars substantially increase the probability of disputes between states. An analysis of conflict narratives shows that the increased risk of interstate conflict associated with civil wars is primarily driven by states' efforts to affect the outcome of the civil war through strategies of intervention and externalization and not by an increase in conflicts over unrelated issues.},

  Abstract                 = { ABSTRACT Democracy does not evolve sui generis. The spatial clustering in democracy and transitions suggests that international factors play a prominent role in forging democracies as well as influencing their durability. We argue that democracy often comes about as a result of changes in the relative power of important actors and groups as well as their evaluations of particular institutions, both of which are often influenced by forces outside the country in question. The scope and extent of connections with other democratic countries in a region can strengthen support for democratic reform and help sustain institutions in transitional democracies. Results from a transition model demonstrate that international factors can exert a strong influence on the prospects for transitions to democracy, and the spatial clustering in democracy and transitions cannot adequately be explained by the hypothesized domestic social requisites of individual countries.We are grateful for comments from Brian A&apos;Hearn, Kyle Beardsley, Nathaniel Beck, Scott Gates, H&aring;vard Hegre, David Lektzian, Jon Pevehouse, Dan Reiter, Kenneth Schultz, Heather Smith, H&aring;vard Strand, and Kaare Str&oslash;m, the editors, and two anonymous reviewers, as well as the participants at the Conference on the International Diffusion of Democracy and Markets, University of California, Los Angeles, March 2003, and the Conference on the International Diffusion of Political and Economic Liberalization at the Weatherhead Center for International Affairs, Harvard University, Cambridge, Mass., October 2003. },

  Abstract                 = {The Polity data are widely used to explore the causes and consequences of democratic authority patterns. These data often have been used uncritically. The authors explore some of the theoretical and empirical characteristics of these data. They show how the analytical composition of the well-known democracy and autocracy scores is not upheld by an empirical analysis of the component measurements and demonstrate that democracy, as measured by the Polity indicators, is fundamentally a reflection of decisional constraints on the chief executive. The recruitment and participation dimensions are shown to be empirically extraneous despite their centrality in democratic theory. The authors conclude that it is a mistake to overlook the categorical nature of these data and that an analysis of the constituent authority patterns is likely to be fruitful for the democratic peace and democratization literature.},

  Abstract                 = {Countries that share rivers have a higher risk of military disputes, even when controlling for a range of standard variables from studies of interstate conflict. A study incorporating the length of the land boundary showed that the shared river variable is not just a proxy for a higher degree of interaction opportunity. A weakness of earlier work is that the existing shared rivers data do not distinguish properly between dyads where the rivers run mainly across the boundary and dyads where the shared river runs along the boundary. Dyads with fivers running across the boundary would be expected to give rise to resource scarcity-related conflict. while in dyads where the fiver forms the boundary conflict may arise because fiver boundaries are fluid and fuzzy. Using a new dataset on shared water basins and two measures of water scarcity, we test for the relevance of these two scenarios. Shared basins do predict an increased propensity for conflict in a multivariate analysis. However, we find little support for the fuzzy boundary scenario. Support for a scarcity theory of water conflict is somewhat ambiguous. Neither the number of river crossings nor the share of the basin upstream is significant. Dry countries have more conflict, but less so when the basin is large. Drought has no influence. The size of the basin, however, is significantly associated with conflict. Modernization theory receives some support in that development interacted with basin size predicts less conflict, and we find some evidence here for an environmental Kuznets curve. The importance of basin size suggests a possible 'resource curse' effect for water resources. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Armed conflict remains a serious problem in the post-Cold War period. For three decades, the Correlates of War project has served as the main supplier of reliable data used in longitudinal studies of external and internal armed conflict. The COW datasets on war use the relatively high threshold of 1,000 battle-deaths. The Uppsala dataset on armed conflict has a lower threshold, 25 annual battle-deaths, but has so far been available for only the post-Cold War period. This dataset has now been backdated to the end of World War II. This article presents a report on armed conflict based on this backdate as well as another annual update. It presents the procedures for the backdating, as well as trends over time and breakdowns for the type of conflict. It assesses the criteria for measuring armed conflict and discusses some directions for future data collection in this area.},

Instead, the author suggests that American unipolarity had already debilitated the council, just as bipolarity paralyzed it during the Cold War. The author argues that it was the rise in American unipolarity--not the Iraq crisis--that, along with cultural clashes and different attitudes toward the use of force, gradually eroded the Security Council's credibility. Another general source of disagreement that has undermined the UN, says the author, concerns when international rules should be made. More than anything else, however, according to the author, it has been still another underlying difference in attitude--over the need to comply with the UN's rules on the use of force--that has proved most disabling to the UN system.

  Abstract                 = {Most of the burgeoning theoretical and empirical literature on the role of leaders in comparative politics and international relations is built on the assumption that leaders choose policies to stay in office. However, leaders can lose office in a variety of ways. Leaders can lose office as a result of ill health; they can lose office in a regular manner; or they can be removed in an irregular manner such as by a coup. How a leader loses office, moreover, significantly affects the leader's subsequent fate. A broader perspective on not just the probability, but also the manner of losing office--and its associated consequences--thus suggests an additional mechanism to explain the behavior of leaders. If policy significantly affects not just whether, but also how, leaders lose office, leaders might design policy to minimize the anticipated negative consequences of losing office. Once we unpack the manner in which leaders lose office, for example, we see that the postulated logic of diversionary war only holds for a subgroup of leaders: those who fear an irregular removal from office.},

  Abstract                 = {What makes wars drag on and why do they end when they do? Here H. E. Goemans brings theoretical rigor and empirical depth to a long-standing question of securities studies. He explores how various government leaders assess the cost of war in terms of domestic politics and their own postwar fates. Goemans first develops the argument that two sides will wage war until both gain sufficient knowledge of the other's strengths and weaknesses so as to agree on the probable outcome of continued war. Yet the incentives that motivate leaders to then terminate war, Goemans maintains, can vary greatly depending on the type of government they represent. The author looks at democracies, dictatorships, and mixed regimes and compares the willingness among leaders to back out of wars or risk the costs of continued warfare. Democracies, according to Goemans, will prefer to withdraw quickly from a war they are not winning in order to appease the populace. Autocracies will do likewise so as not to be overthrown by their internal enemies. Mixed regimes, which are made up of several competing groups and which exclude a substantial proportion of the people from access to power, will likely see little risk in continuing a losing war in the hope of turning the tide. Goemans explores the conditions and the reasoning behind this "gamble for resurrection" as well as other strategies, using rational choice theory, statistical analysis, and detailed case studies of Germany, Britain, France, and Russia during World War I. In so doing, he offers a new perspective of the Great War that integrates domestic politics, international politics, and battlefield developments.},

  Abstract                 = {Chiozza and Goemans seek to explain why and when political leaders decide to initiate international crises and wars. They argue that the fate of leaders and the way leadership changes shapes leaders' decisions to initiate international conflict. Leaders who anticipate regular removal from office, through elections for example, have little to gain and much to lose from international conflict, whereas leaders who anticipate a forcible removal from office, such as through coup or revolution, have little to lose and much to gain from conflict. This theory is tested against an extensive analysis of more than 80 years of international conflict and with an intensive historical examination of Central American leaders from 1848 to 1918. Leaders and International Conflict highlights the political nature of the choice between war and peace and will appeal to all scholars of international relations and comparative politics.}

  Abstract                 = {We present and process-trace a complete information model of diversionary war. In our model, leaders must retain the support of some fraction of a selectorate whose response in turn depends on the outcome of an international conflict. The need to retain the loyalty of a segment of the selectorate generates institutionally-induced risk preferences in leaders. Under specified conditions, this in turn results in the leadersâ choice of risky options and war emerges as a rational gamble. We analyze when the leader prefers to impose such a gamble, what the optimal gamble would be, and its effect on crisis bar- gaining between two leaders. We find that when leaders have institutionally-induced risk preferences, whether leaders rationally choose to initiate or continue a war can depend on which selectorate cares most about the outcome of the conflict. A reexamination of the bargaining over a settlement to end the First World War in December 1916âJanuary 1917 and Germanyâs contemporaneous consideration of unrestricted submarine warfare allows us to demonstrate the empirical relevance of the model.},

  Abstract                 = {Scholars for a long time theorized about the role of political leaders, but empirical research has been limited by the lack of systematic data about individual leaders. Archigos is a new dataset with information on leaders in 188 countries from 1875 to 2004. We provide an overview of the main features of this data. Archigos specifically identifies the effective leaders of each independent state; it codes when and how leaders came into power, their age, and their gender, as well as their personal fate one year after they lost office. We illustrate the utility of the Archigos dataset by demonstrating how leader attributes predict other features of interest in International Relations and Comparative Politics. Crisis interactions differ depending on whether leaders face each other for the first time or have had prior interactions. Irregular leader changes can help identify political change in autocracies not apparent from data that consider only the democratic nature of institutions. Finally, transitions to democracy in the third wave are more likely to fail in instances where autocratic rulers were punished after leaving office. Our examples illustrate new empirical findings that simply could not be explored in existing data sources. Although selective, our overview demonstrates how Archigos bears considerable promise in providing answers to new and old research questions and opens up new avenues for research on individual leaders as decisionmakers.},

  Abstract                 = {The structural Quantal Response Equilibrium (QRE) generalizes the Nash equilibrium by augmenting payoffs with random elements that are not removed in some limit. This approach has been widely used both as a theoretical framework to study comparative statics of games and as an econometric framework to analyze experimental and field data. The framework of structural QRE is flexible: it can be applied to arbitrary finite games and incorporate very general error structures. Restrictions on the error structure are needed, however, to place testable restrictions on the data (Haile et al., 2004). This paper proposes a reduced-form approach, based on quantal response functions that replace the best-response functions underlying the Nash equilibrium. We define a regular QRE as a fixed point of quantal response functions that satisfies four axioms: continuity, interiority, responsiveness, and monotonicity. We show that these conditions are not vacuous and demonstrate with an example that they imply economically sensible restrictions on data consistent with laboratory observations. The reduced-form approach allows for a richer set of regular quantal response functions, which has proven useful for estimation purposes. },

Given our estimates, we compute Nash equilibria of a product location game and find that firms' observed strategies (such as the degree of product differentiation) are generally optimal. Discrepancies between actual and optimal strategies reflect the networks' adherence to "rules of thumb" and, possibly, bounded rationality behavior.},

  Abstract                 = {Scale-free ~SF! networks exhibiting a power-law degree distribution can be grouped into the assortative, dissortative, and neutral networks according to the behavior of the degree-degree correlation coefficient. Here we investigate the betweenness centrality ~BC! correlation for each type of SF networks. While the BC-BC correlation coefficients behave similarly to the degree-degree correlation coefficients for the dissortative and neutral networks, the BC correlation is nontrivial for the assortative ones found mainly in social networks. The mean BC of neighbors of a vertex with BC gi is almost independent of gi , implying that each person is surrounded by almost the same influential environments of people no matter how influential the person may be.},

  Abstract                 = {If the purpose of legalization is to enhance international cooperation, more may not always be better. Achieving the optimal level of legalization requires finding a balance between reducing the risks of opportunism and reducing the potential negative effects of legalization on domestic political processes. The global trade regime, which aims to liberalize trade, has become increasingly legalized over time. Increased legalization has changed the information environment and the nature of government obligations, which in turn have affected the pattern of mobilization of domestic interest groups on trade. From the perspective of encouraging the future expansion of liberal trade, we suggest some possible negative consequences of legalization, arguing that these consequences must be weighed against the positive effects of legalization on increasing national compliance, Since the weakly legalized GATT institution proved sufficient to sustain widespread liberalization, the case for further legalization must be strong to justify far-reaching change in the global trade regime.},

This article comprehensively evaluates the effects of the GATT/WTO and other trade agreements since World War II. Our analysis is organized around two factors: institutional standing and institutional embeddedness. We show that many countries had rights and obligations, or institutional standing, in the {GATT}/WTO even though they were not formal members of the agreement. We also expand the analysis to include a range of other coinmercial agreements that were embedded with the {GATT}/WTO. Using data on dyadic trade since 1946, we demonstrate that the {GATT}/WTO substantially increased trade for countries with institutional standing, and that other embedded agreements had similarly positive effects. Moreover, our evidence suggests that international trade agreements have complemented, rather than undercut, each other.},

Finally, it presents a new table for performing the Kolmogorov-Smirnof test for goodness-of-fit tailored to power-law distributions in which the power-law exponent is estimated using MLE. The techniques presented here will advance the application of complex network theory by allowing reliable estimation of power-law models from data and further allowing quantitative assessment of goodness-of-fit of proposed power-law models to empirical data.},

  Abstract                 = {Examining onsets of political instability in countries worldwide from 1955 to 2003, we develop a model that distinguishes countries that experienced instability from those that remained stable with a two-year lead time and over 80\% accuracy. Intriguingly, the model uses few variables and a simple specification. The model is accurate in forecasting the onsets of both violent civil wars and nonviolent democratic reversals, suggesting common factors in both types of change. Whereas regime type is typically measured using linear or binary indicators of democracy/autocracy derived from the 21-point Polity scale, the model uses a nonlinear five-category measure of regime type based on the Polity components. This new measure of regime type emerges as the most powerful predictor of instability onsets, leading us to conclude that political institutions, properly specified, and not economic conditions, demography, or geography, are the most important predictors of the onset of political instability.},

  Abstract                 = {The Colonel Blotto game captures strategic situations in which players attempt to mismatch an opponentâs action. We extend Colonel Blotto to a class of General Blotto games that allow for more general payoffs and externalities between fronts. These extensions make Blotto applicable to a variety of real-world problems. We find that like Colonel Blotto, most General Blotto games do not have pure strategy equilibria. Using a replicator dynamics learning model, we show that General Blotto may have more predictable dynamics than the original Blotto game. Thus, adding realistic structure to Colonel Blotto may, paradoxically, make it less complex.},

  Abstract                 = {Does it matter whether banking supervision is undertaken in-house in the Central Bank or in a separate specialised supervisory institution? After all, bank supervisors and the Central Bank must continue to work closely together wherever the supervisors are located. Nevertheless there has been a recent trend towards hiving off bank supervision to a separate agency, as in the UK. The main driving forces are the rise of the universal bank, increased conglomeration, and concerns with conflicts of interest. Such separation, however, raises questions whether systemic stability might suffer. The ethos and culture of the separate supervisor might come to focus more on conduct of business, consumer protection, issues. Potentially systemic financial crises would have to be handled by a committee. These are qualitative issues, and developed countries, with differing historical, legal and institutional backgrounds, will come to differing conclusions. But in less developed countries, more weight needs to be placed on ensuring the quality of the supervisory staff, i.e. their professional skills, independence from external pressures, and adequate funding. This tells strongly towards retaining banking supervision under the wing of the Central Bank in such emerging countries. (J.E.L.: E5, F3, G2).},

The frequency of price revision, size of spread, and statistical characteristics are measured. The series exhibit (time varying) leptokurtosis, unit roots, and first-order negative correlation, the latter especially in disturbed [`]jumpy' markets. The effect of time aggregation on these characteristics is examined, and variance ratios are analyzed. Multivariate analysis revealed significant relationships between lagged exchange rates, both the own rate and the key deutsche mark/US dollar rate, and the current spot rate.},

  Abstract                 = {The paper investigates whether monetary policy and banking supervision should be separated. The main argument for separation is that the combination of functions might lead to a conflict of interest. An argument against is that separation is inconsistent with the central bank's concern for the systemic stability of the financial system. In a cross-country survey of 104 bank failures, we observe a trend towards using taxpayers' money for bank rescues which strengthens the case for hiving off the supervisory function to a government agency. It would, however, be difficult to have a complete division, since the central bank generally remains the only source of immediate funding.},

  Abstract                 = {Existing models of trade policy, based on interest group activity and the preferences of the median voter, have contributed greatly to our understanding of endogenous tariff formation. Neither model, however, can explain some of the well-known empirical regularities in trade policy. In this paper, I present a framework for understanding trade policy in which protection is treated as a discrete income transfer, analogous to Ã¢â¬Åpork,Ã¢â¬ï¿½ that can be targeted to particular constituencies or groups. The underlying model of benefit allocation flows from earlier work by Lindbeck and Weibull (1987) and Dixit and Londregan (1996). In order to justify the choice of trade policy as a valued form of transfer, I start with a depiction of the utility function of a local representative. This indicates how their advocacy for either import tariffs or export subsidies is related to the share of a given industry in their district. An increase in the number of districts, ceteris paribus, will increase the likelihood that output shares for an industry approach a threshold at which trade protection becomes attractive in at least one district. Next, looking at the determination of national trade policy, I compare the expected targeting of trade policy benefits to districts in PR and majoritarian systems. Since, in PR systems, more seats are "marginal", the expected level of trade protection will be higher under PR systems. The lower number of districts within PR systems, however, offsets this effect because it diminishes the salience of trade policy as a valued benefit within each district. In order to test the effect of districts and electoral systems on trade policy, I estimate a model of trade protection. To construct my dependent variable, I use newly available data from the World Bank that estimates the ad valorem equivalent of non-tariff barriers at the six digit HS level of disaggregation and allows scholars to combine information on NTB's and tariffs in a single metric. The results confirm the hypotheses drawn from theory, at least for those countries that are most free. Ceteris paribus, trade protection is higher in PR systems than under majoritarian electoral systems and rises with the number of districts. Finally, I test a corollary hypothesis on the coefficient of variation in trade protection investigating whether the more focused targeting of trade benefits to marginal districts in majoritarian systems leads to greater variation in protection across categories of goods. The results suggest moderate but not overwhelming support for this hypothesis.},

  Abstract                 = {This paper develops a spatial merger estimator to explain political integration generally and then applies this method to a wave of school district mergers in the state of Iowa during the 1990s. Our estimator is rooted in the economics of matching and thus accounts for three important features of typical merger protocol: two-sided decision making, multiple potential partners, and spatial interdependence. Rather than simply explaining when a particular region is likely to experience a wave of political integration, our method allows us to explore the factors driving which specific subregional mergers take place. This allows us to explore how those districts that merge choose with which of their neighbors to do so. Our results highlight the importance of state financial incentives for consolidation, economies of scale, diseconomies of scale, and a variety of heterogeneity measures in this particular application. We also demonstrate the power of our estimator, relative to existing estimators, to detect a statistically significant role for heterogeneity factors. While our application is limited to school district consolidation, our method can be adapted to include the salient features of many spatial integration problems.},

We propose that corporations use political expenditures in part to &ldquo;flex their muscles&rdquo; to regulators and convey their willingness to fight an agency&apos;s specific determinations in the political arena. Because the signaling function of political expenditures is strategically complex, we derive a formal model wherein we demonstrate the existence of an equilibrium in which (1) large political donors are less compliant than smaller ones, but the bureaucracy monitors them less, and (2) firms with publicly observable problems reduce their political expenditures. We test the empirical implications of the model using plant-level data from the Nuclear Regulatory Commission on the inspection of 63 privately operated nuclear power plants and the political expenditures of their parent companies. We find strong evidence for the first prediction and qualified support for the second.},

  Abstract                 = {The international system is not only an expression of domestic structures, but a cause of them. Two schools of analysis exploring the impact of the international system upon domestic politics (regime types, institutions, coalitions, policies) may be distinguished: those which stress the international economy, and those which stress political-military rivalry, or war. Among the former are such arguments as: late industrialization (associated with Gershenkron); dependencia or core-periphery arguments (Wallerstein); liberal development model (much American writing in the 50s and 60s); transnational relation-modernization (Nye, Keohane, Morse); neo-mercantilists (Gilpin); state-centered Marxists (Schurmann). Arguments stressing the role of war include those which focus on the organizational requirements of providing security (Hintze, Anderson), the special nature of foreign relations (classical political theory), territorial compensation (diplomatic history), and strains of foreign involvement (analysis of revolutions). These arguments provide the basis for criticism of much of the literature which uses domestic structure as an explanation of foreign policy, in particular those which (such as the strong-state weak-state distinction) tend, by excessive focus on forms, to obscure the connection between structures and interests, and the role of politics. These arguments also permit criticism of the notion of a recent fundamental discontinuity in the nature of international relations.},

  Abstract                 = {Analysis of social networks is suggested as a tool for linking micro and macro levels of sociological theory. The procedure is illustrated by elaboration of the macro implications of one aspect of small-scale interaction: the strength of dyadic ties. It is argued that the degree of overlap of two individuals' friendship networks varies directly with the strength of their tie to one another. The impact of this principle on diffusion of influence and information, mobility opportunity, and community organization is explored. Stress is laid on the cohesive power of weak ties. Most network models deal, implicitly, with strong ties, thus confining their applicability to small, well-defined groups. Emphasis on weak ties lends itself to discussion of relations between groups and to analysis of segments of social structure not easily defined in terms of primary groups.},

  Abstract                 = { This paper assesses the relative importance of force employment as a cause of military victory. It focuses on the adoption of the modern system in interstate wars since 1917. Using cases, contingency tables, and regression analysis, we find that war participants who use the modern system are significantly more likely to succeed in decisive battlefield engagements. However, the modern system does not predict victory at a higher rate than more traditional unit-level explanations for combat effectiveness, suggesting that it might function as a causal mechanism linking factors like regime type and material endowments with martial capabilities. Exploring the possible links between unit-level explanations of military power and the organizational-level force employment indicators, we find that more materially powerful states and democracies tend to implement the modern system at a higher rate than other types of actors, but more extreme autocracies also frequently adopt. Combined, these findings suggest the relevance of continuing to explore how organizational-level variables impact military effectiveness. },

When analyzing dependent variables,such as the occurrence of a militarized dispute or the level of tradebetween two nations, researchers tend to work with panel data sets ofNTobservations, where N is the number of dyads (pairs of nations) and T isthe number of time points (typically years). Thus, for example, whensixty nations are observed annually over the span of forty years, thepooled cross-sectional data set consists of 1,770 dyads [times] forty years =70,800 observations. These data are said to be &ldquo;pooled&rdquo; in that nodistinction is made between observations in time and space. A datum is adatum, and one can draw inferences with equal certitude across dyads oracross years. },

This technique allows the analyst to evaluate model fit based upon the modelsâ ability to consistently match high-probability predictions to actual occurrences of the event of interest, and low-probability predictions to nonoccurrences of the event of interest. Unlike existing methods for assessing predictive power for logit and probit models such as Percent Correctly Predicted statistics, Brier scores, and the ROC plot, our âseparation plotâ has the advantage of producing a visual display that is informative and easy to explain to a general audience, while also remaining insensitive to the often arbitrary probability thresholds that are used to distinguish between predicted events and nonevents. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this technique in building predictive models in a number of different areas of political research.},

  Abstract                 = {There is a paucity of facts about the effects of the recent military Surge on conditions in Iraq and whether it is paving the way for a stable Iraq. Selective, anecdotal and incomplete analyses abound. Policy makers and defense planners must decide which measures of success or failure are most important, but until now few, if any, systematic analyses were available on which to base those decisions. This paper applies modern statistical techniques to a new data file derived from more than a dozen of the most reliable and widely-cited sources to assess the Surge's impact on three key dimensions: the functioning of the Iraqi state (including civilian casualties); military casualties; and financial markets' assessment of Iraq's future. The new and unusually rigorous findings presented here should help inform current evaluations of the Surge and provide a basis for better decision making about future strategy. The analysis reveals mixed evidence on the Surge's effect on key trends in Iraq. The security situation has improved insofar as civilian fatalities have declined without any concurrent increase in casualties among coalition and Iraqi troops. However, other areas, such as oil production and the number of trained Iraqi Security Forces have shown no improvement or declined. Evaluating such conflicting indicators is challenging. There is, however, another way to assess the Surge. This paper shows how data from world financial markets can be used to shed light on the central question of whether the Surge has increased or diminished the prospect of today's Iraq surviving into the future. In particular, I examine the price of Iraqi state bonds, which the Iraqi government is currently servicing, on world financial markets. After the Surge, there is a sharp decline in the price of those bonds, relative to alternative bonds. The decline signaled a 40\% increase in the market's expectation that Iraq will default. This finding suggests that to date the Surge is failing to pave the way toward a stable Iraq and may in fact be undermining it.},

We then show that Condorcet's (1785) model of collective judgment shares these assumptions with Rousseau and that understanding the implications of Condorcet's (1785) @'jury theorem@' enables us to clarify many of the most obscure aspects of Rousseaus's treatment of the general will, including his discussion of the debilitating effects of factions and his confidence in the ability of the Assembly of the People to discern the general will by means of voting.},

  Abstract                 = {Combinations of random and preferential growth for both on-growing and stationary networks are studied and a hierarchical topology is observed. Thus for real world scale-free networks which do not exhibit hierarchical features preferential growth is probably not the main ingredient in the growth process. An example of such real world networks includes the protein-protein interaction network in yeast, which exhibits pronounced anti-hierarchical features},

  Abstract                 = {Interest group ratings are widely used in studies of legislative behavior. Since the set of votes used is not constant over time and across chambers, the scales underlying the scores can shift and stretch. We introduce an econometric model that corrects the problem. Specifically, we derive an index, much like an inflation index for consumer prices, that allows one to make intertemporal and interchamber comparisons of interest group ratings. The adjusted scores for the ADA show a strong liberal trend in the average member of Congress during 1947-94, followed by a conservative reversal. A nonparametric test using ADA and ACU scores demonstrates the validity of adjusted scores and the invalidity of nominal scores for intertemporal and interchamber comparisons. Using two studies (Levitt 1996; Shipan and Lowry 1997) we illustrate that the choice of adjusted versus nominal scores may greatly affect substantive conclusions of researchers.},

  Abstract                 = {An important class of bargaining problems involve two negotiators who send signals to a third party. We show that these signaling incentives significantly influence (1) the proposals that they offer and (2) their decisions to accept or reject proposals. Consider the following case: Congress makes a take-it-or-leave-it offer (a bill) to the president, who either signs or vetoes it. A third party is uninformed about the president's preferences; however, by observing the bill that Congress writes and the president's veto decisions, it can learn about these preferences. Since in our model the president wants to appear moderate to voters, while Congress wants him to appear extreme, Congress sometimes writes a bill that it knows the president will veto. Thus, despite Congress and the president being completely informed, an uninformed third party causes the outcome to be Pareto inefficient. The model generates many empirical predictions, and we test one of these-that the president's approval rating should drop after a veto.},

  Abstract                 = {Minimal winning coalitions have appeared as a key prediction or as an essential assumption of virtually all formal models of coalition formation, vote buying, and logrolling. Notwithstanding this research, we provide a model showing that supermajority coalitions may be cheaper than minimal winning coalitions. Specifically, if vote buyers move sequentially, and if the losing vote buyer is always granted a last chance to attack the winner's coalition, then minimal winning coalitions will generally not be cheapest, and equilibrium coalitions will generally not be minimal winning. We provide results relating equilibrium coalition size with preferences of the legislators and vote buyers, and we show that minimal winning coalitions should occur in only rare cases. We discuss these results in light of empirical work on coalition size and suggest other possible avenues for testing our model.},

  Abstract                 = {We develop a novel model of campaigns, elections, and policy-making in which the ex ante objectives of national party leaders differ from the ex post objectives of elected legislators. This generates a distinction between "policy rhetoric" and "policy reality" and introduces an important role for "party discipline" in the policy-making process. We identify a protectionist bias in majoritarian politics. When trade policy is chosen by the majority delegation and legislators in the minority have limited means to influence choices, the parties announce trade policies that favor specific factors, and the expected tariff or export subsidy is positive. Positions and expected outcomes monotonically approach free trade as party discipline strengthens.},

We show that each party is induced to behave as if it were maximizing a weighted sum of the aggregate welfares of informed voters and members of special interest groups. The party that is expected to win a majority of seats caters more to the special interests.},

The optimal form of redistribution from the perspective of property owners is a wage subsidy. But, if a wage subsidy is too costly to administer, then the property owners are willing to provide lump-sum transfers instead. In either case, redistribution causes the workers to refrain from extralegal appropriative activities - in effect, it induces them to acquiesce in the existing property ownership - and it increases the utility of the workers without decreasing the net income of the property owners.},

  Abstract                 = {Economists, financial commentators, regulatory agencies, and the legal community have recently criticized the Nasdaq Stock Market, Inc., because there is greater clustering of stock quotations on even-eights on Nasdaq than on the New York Stock Exchange or the American Stock Exchange, a phenomenon which critics attribute to collusion or some other defect in Nasdaq market structure. However, as this article demonstrates, clustering occurs in varying degrees in many other incontestably competitive financial markets, including the NYSE, the AMEX, the London Stock Exchange, the London gold market, and the international foreign exchange market. This article provides a competitive theory of clustering that emphasizes the effect of uncertainty, the size of transactions, volatility, and the informational and transactional roles of quotations on the degree of clustering. In addition, the article examines how market structure can affect the degree of clustering and considers the relation between clustering, spreads, and investors' transactions costs.},

  Abstract                 = {We estimate the impact of changes in abortion access in the early 1970s on the average living standards of cohorts born in those years. In particular, we address the selection inherent in the abortion decision: is the marginal child who is not born when abortion access increases more or less disadvantaged than the average child? Legalization of abortion in five states around 1970, followed by legalization nationwide due to the 1973 Roe v. Wade decision, generates natural variation which can be used to estimate the effect of abortion access. We find that cohorts born after abortion was legalized experienced a significant reduction in a number of adverse outcomes. Our estimates imply that the marginal child who was not born due to legalization would have been 70\% more likely to live in a single parent family, 40\% more likely to live in poverty, 50\% more likely to receive welfare, and 35\% more likely to die as an infant. These selection effects imply that the legalization of abortion saved the government over \$14 billion in welfare expenditures through 1994.},

Considering first-price sealed-bid auction models within the independent private value paradigm, we show that the underlying distribution of bidders' private values is identified from observed bids and the number of actual bidders without any parametric assumptions. Using the theory of minimax, we establish the best rate of uniform convergence at which the latent density of private values can be estimated nonparametrically from available data. We then propose a two-step kernel-based estimator that converges at the optimal rate.},

  Abstract                 = {This article studies the effects of conflict onset on asset markets applying the event study methodology. The authors consider a sample of 101 internal and inter-state conflicts during the period 1974—2004 and find that a sizeable fraction of them has had a significant impact on stock market indices, exchange rates, oil and commodity prices. This fraction is inconsistent with pure chance, that is, with the selected probability of type-I errors in our tests of statistical significance. The results suggest that, on average, national stock markets are more likely to display positive than negative reactions to conflict onset. When the authors distinguish between internal and inter-state conflicts, they find that the fraction of significant results is higher for international conflicts. When the authors classify events according to the region where they occur, they find that Asia and the Middle East are the regions where conflicts tend to have the strongest effects. Finally, the article reports evidence that abnormal returns would have accrued to investors systematically exploiting conflict onset to implement conflict-driven strategies. Results are robust to selecting a subset of high-intensity conflicts and to expanding the time window over which conflict events are defined. The findings of the article confirm the economic importance of the effects of conflicts on asset markets.},

We focus on diamond mining firms and conduct an event study on the sudden end of the conflict, marked by the death of the rebel movement leader in 2002. We find that the stock market perceived this event as "bad news" rather than "good news" for companies holding concessions in Angola, as their abnormal returns declined by 4 percentage points. The event had no effect on a control portfolio of otherwise similar diamond mining companies. This finding is corroborated by other events and by the adoption of alternative methodologies. We interpret our findings in light of conflict-generated entry barriers, government bargaining power, and transparency in the licensing process. (JEL D74, G32, O13, O17, Q34)},

  Abstract                 = {Rationale: Upper airway muscle function plays a major role in maintenance of the upper airway patency and contributes to the genesis of obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (OSAS). Preliminary results suggested that oropharyngeal exercises derived from speech therapy may be an effective treatment option for patients with moderate OSAS. Objectives: To determine the impact of oropharyngeal exercises in patients with moderate OSAS. Methods: Thirty-one patients with moderate OSAS were randomized to 3 months of daily ([~]30 min) sham therapy (n = 15, control) or a set of oropharyngeal exercises (n = 16), consisting of exercises involving the tongue, soft palate, and lateral pharyngeal wall. Measurements and Main Results: Anthropometric measurements, snoring frequency (range 0-4), intensity (1-3), Epworth daytime sleepiness (0-24) and Pittsburgh sleep quality (0-21) questionnaires, and full polysomnography were performed at baseline and at study conclusion. Body mass index and abdominal circumference of the entire group were 30.3 {+/-} 3.4 kg/m2 and 101.4 {+/-} 9.0 cm, respectively, and did not change significantly over the study period. No significant change occurred in the control group in all variables. In contrast, patients randomized to oropharyngeal exercises had a significant decrease (P < 0.05) in neck circumference (39.6 {+/-} 3.6 vs. 38.5 {+/-} 4.0 cm), snoring frequency (4 [4-4] vs. 3 [1.5-3.5]), snoring intensity (3 [3-4] vs. 1 [1-2]), daytime sleepiness (14 {+/-} 5 vs. 8 {+/-} 6), sleep quality score (10.2 {+/-} 3.7 vs. 6.9 {+/-} 2.5), and OSAS severity (apnea-hypopnea index, 22.4 {+/-} 4.8 vs. 13.7 {+/-} 8.5 events/h). Changes in neck circumference correlated inversely with changes in apnea-hypopnea index (r = 0.59; P < 0.001). Conclusions: Oropharyngeal exercises significantly reduce OSAS severity and symptoms and represent a promising treatment for moderate OSAS.

Singapore is ranked second followed by New Zealand in third. Zimbabwe once again has the lowest level of economic freedom among the 141 jurisdictions included in the study, followed by Angola and Myanmar. The annual peer-reviewed Economic Freedom of the World report is produced by CanadaÃ¢â¬â¢s Fraser Institute in cooperation with independent institutes in 75 nations and territories. It uses 42 different measures to create an index ranking countries around the world based on policies that encourage economic freedom. The cornerstones of economic freedom are personal choice, voluntary exchange, freedom to compete, and security of private property. Economic freedom is measured in five different areas: (1) size of government; (2) legal structure and security of property rights; (3) access to sound money; (4) freedom to trade internationally; and (5) regulation of credit, labor and business. Research shows that individuals living in countries with high levels of economic freedom enjoy higher levels of prosperity, greater individual freedoms, and longer life spans. This yearÃ¢â¬â¢s report also contains new research showing the impact of economic freedom on poverty reduction. Ã¢â¬ÅEconomic freedom is one of the key building blocks of the most prosperous nations around the world. Countries with high levels of economic freedom are those in which people enjoy high standards of living and personal freedoms. Countries at the bottom of the index face the opposite situation; their citizens are often mired in poverty, are governed by totalitarian regimes and have few if any, individual rights or freedoms,Ã¢â¬ï¿½ said Fred McMahon, Fraser Institute director of trade and globalization studies.},

To capture this complexity, the authors produced an actors' network analysis drawing on one of the largest event databases today. The aim was to identify the main actors involved in the conflict, track down the most important conflictive and cooperative ties between actors, and compare the quality and intensity of interactions among actor groups. In total, 2,818 events reported between 2002 and 2005 were assigned forty-four actors categories. Measures of centrality and power and a combination of principal component and cluster analysis were used to produce graphs of the network. The authors found civilians to be the most important actors, closely followed by the Russian military, the Chechen fighters, and the Chechen government. The results are discussed in light of the current situation in Chechnya with reference to chances and limitations of the network approach with event data.},

The key insight we deliver is that, for typical sovereign debt contracts, the probability of debt repayment will equal the probability of victory in a civil war. We test our predictor for standard outcomes in civil wars, including when the incumbent government loses (the Chinese Nationalists), when a new government is installed by a foreign power and decides to repudiate debt (the restoration of Ferdinand VII of Spain), and when there is a secession (the U.S. Confederacy). For China, markets were predicting a Communist victory three years before it happened. For the U.S., markets never gave the South much more than a 40 percent chance of maintaining the Confederacy. For Spain, markets considered the restoration of Ferdinand VII as likely (probabilities above 50\%) as soon as France declared its intention to send military forces to the area. },

Nongovernmental organizations, news media, and international organizations publicize countries' violations and urge reform. Evidence that these spotlights are followed by improvements is anecdotal. This article analyzes the relationship between global naming and shaming efforts and governments' human rights practices for 145 countries from 1975 to 2000. The statistics show that governments put in the spotlight for abuses continue or even ramp up some violations afterward, while reducing others. One reason is that governments' capacities for human rights improvements vary across types of violations. Another is that governments are strategically using some violations to offset other improvements they make in response to international pressure to stop violations.},

  Abstract                 = {A growing number of international relations scholars argue that intergovernmental organizations (IGOs) promote peace. Existing approach esemphasize IGO membership as an important causal attribute of individual states, much like economic development and regime type. The authors use social network analysis to show that IGO memberships also create a disparate distribution of social power, significantly shaping conflicts between states. Membership partitions states into structurally equivalent clusters and establishes hierarchies of prestige in the international system. These relative positions promote common beliefs and alter the distribution of social power, making certain policy strategies more practical or rational. The authors introduce new IGO relational data and explore the empirical merits of their approach during the period from 1885 to 1992. They demonstrate that conflict is increased by the presence of many other states in structurally equivalent clusters, while large prestige disparities and in-group favoritism decrease it.},

  Abstract                 = {The increasing number and expansion of trading blocs is an important dimension of the contemporary international economy. This study examines the effects of such trading blocs on third parties and on the multilateral trading system. It is argued that trading blocs have negative economic effects on economic sectors in non-members' states. These sectors urge their governments to take political action vis-a-vis the trading bloc. Governments have several policy choices on their menu, and the attractiveness of these policies is determined by domestic and international incentives and constraints. I argue that filing a complaint in the GATT/WTO is an attractive and effective policy tool in the hands of third parties' governments. Thus, I hypothesize that the existence, deepening, and widening of trading blocs result in an increase in the number of complaints filed against their members in the multilateral trading system. I examine these propositions in the context of three important trading blocs-namely, the EU, NAFTA, and Mercosur-in the period 1948-2000. To test these hypotheses a time-series cross-section count model is performed. Controlling for conventional alternative explanations, the empirical analysis supports the theoretical framework.},

Under the assumption that the treatment is ignorable given some observed characteristics, it is shown that the propensity score is ancillary for estimation of the average treatment effects. The propensity score is not ancillary for estimation of average treatment effects on the treated. It is suggested that the marginal value of the propensity score lies entirely in the "dimension reduction." Efficient semiparametric estimators of average treatment effects and average treatment effects on the treated are shown to take the form of relevant sample averages of the data completed by the nonparametric imputation method. It is shown that the projection on the propensity score is not necessary for efficient semiparametric estimation of average treatment effects on the treated even if the propensity score is known. An application to the experimental data reveals that conditioning on the propensity score may even result in a loss of efficiency.},

Palfrey (1995) has recently attracted considerable attention, due in part to its widely documented ability to rationalize observed behavior in games played by experimental subjects. However, even with strong a priori restrictions on unobservables, QRE imposes no falsifiable restrictions: it can rationalize any distribution of behavior in any normal form game. After demonstrating this, we discuss several approaches to testing QRE under additional maintained assumptions. (JEL C72, D84)},

  Abstract                 = {An extensive literature in econometrics and in numerical analysis has considered the problem of evaluating the multiple integral P(B; [mu], [Omega]) = [is proportional to]ab n(v - [mu], [Omega])dv [reverse not equivalent] Ev1(V [epsilon] B), where V is a m-dimensional normal vector with mean [mu], covariance matrix [Omega], and density n(v - [mu], [Omega]), and 1(V [epsilon] B) is an indicator for the event B = (V|a < V < b). A leading case of such an integral is the negative orthant probability, where B = (V |V < 0). The problem is computationally difficult except in very special cases. The multinomial probit (MNP) model used in econometrics and biometrics has cell probabilities that are negative orthant probabilities, with [mu] and [Omega] depending on unknown parameters (and, in general, on covariates). Estimation of this model requires, for each trial parameter vector and each observation in a sample, evaluation of P(B; [mu], [Omega]) and of its derivatives with respect to [mu] and [Omega]. This paper surveys Monte Carlo techniques that have been developed for approximations of P(B; [mu], [Omega]) and its linear and logarithmic derivatives, that limit computation while possessing properties that facilitate their use in iterative calculations for statistical inference: the Crude Frequency Simulator (CFS), Normal Importance Sampling (NIS), a Kernel-Smoothed Frequency Simulator (KFS), Stern's Decomposition Simulator (SDS), the Geweke-Hajivassiliou-Keane Simulator (GHK), a Parabolic Cylinder Function Simulator (PCF), DeÃ¡k's Chi-squared Simulator (DCS), an Acceptance/Rejection Simulator (ARS), the Gibbs Sampler Simulator (GSS), a Sequentially Unbiased Simulator (SUS), and an Approximately Unbiased Simulator (AUS). We also discuss Gauss and FORTRAN implementations of these algorithms and present our computational experience with them. We find that GHK is overall the most reliable method.},

At the outbreak of the war, these nations suspended convertibility of their currencies into gold with the promise that after the war each would restore convertibility at the old par. However, once convertibility was suspended, the value of each currency depended on the outcome of the war. From these exchange rates I extract a common trend and a common factor. Movements in the common trend are consistent with the quantity theory of money. The common factor contains information on contemporaries' expectations about the war's resolution. This common factor and its innovations are correlated with time series on soldiers killed, wounded, and taken prisoner.},

  Abstract                 = {Plans for the European Monetary Union (EMU) are based on the conventional postulate that increasing the independence of the central bank can reduce inflation without any real economic effects. However, the theoretical and empirical bases for this claim rest on models of the economy that make unrealistic information assumptions and omit institutional variables other than the central bank. When signaling problems between the central bank and other actors in the political economy are considered, we find that the character of wage bargaining conditions the impact of central bank independence by rendering the signals between the bank and the bargainers more or less effective. Greater central bank independence can reduce inflation without major employment effects where bargaining is coordinated, but it can bring higher levels of unemployment where bargaining is less coordinated. Thus, currency unions like the EMU may require higher levels of unemployment to control inflation than their proponents envisage. They will have costs as well as benefits, and these will be unevenly distributed among and within the member nations, depending on the changes they induce in the status of the bank and of wage coordination.},

In 1993, when the fiscal-policy criteria for monetary union were first announced, only Luxembourg and the Republic of Ireland would have qualified. In 1997, only Greece failed. Various explanations have been advanced for this rapid turnaround, including luck (a favorable economic climate reduced pressures on local budgets), accounting tricks, and the increasing pressures caused by international capital mobility. Underlying these various explanations is a basic skepticism about whether countries in the European Union actively worked to reform their national budgeting procedures. In rich case studies, Hallerberg shows that the member-states did indeed reform their budget institutions. Many of them, he finds, had started that process long before the formal signing of the Maastricht Treaty of 1991, making domestic changes that allowed them to qualify individually under EMU criteria.},

  Abstract                 = {In Linked Data, the use of owl:sameAs is ubiquitous in 'inter-linking' data-sets. However, there is a lurking sus- picion within the Linked Data community that this use of owl:sameAs may be somehow incorrect, in particular with regards to its interactions with inference. In fact, owl:sameAs can be considered just one type of 'identity link,' a link that declares two items to be identical in some fashion. After reviewing the definitions and history of the problem of identity in philosophy and knowledge representation, we outline four alternative readings of owl:sameAs, showing with ex- amples how it is being (ab)used on the Web of data. Then we present possible solutions to this problem by introducing alternative identity links that rely on named graphs.},

  Abstract                 = {The problem of calculating posterior probabilities for a collection of competing models and associated Bayes factors continues to be a formidable challenge for applied Bayesian statisticians. Current approaches that take advantage of modern Markov chain Monte Carlo computing methods include those that attempt to sample over some form of the joint space created by the model indicators and the parameters for each model, others that sample over the model space alone, and still others that attempt to estimate the marginal likelihood of each model directly (because the collection of these is equivalent to the collection of model probabilities themselves). We review several methods and compare them in the context of three examples: a simple regression example, a more challenging hierarchical longitudinal model, and a binary data latent variable model. We find that the joint model-parameter space search methods perform adequately but can be difficult to program and tune, whereas the marginal likelihood methods often are less troublesome and require less additional coding. Our results suggest that the latter methods may be most appropriate for practitioners working in many standard model choice settings, but the former remain important for comparing models of varying dimension (e.g., multiple changepoint models) or models whose parameters cannot easily be updated in relatively few blocks. We caution, however, that all methods we compared require significant human and computer effort, and this suggests that less formal Bayesian model choice methods may offer a more realistic alternative in many cases.},

  Abstract                 = {What explains the variation of trade protection across countries and years? The author argues that other things equal, democracies with strong parties will choose freer trade policies. He focuses on two aspects of party strength-organizational centralization and stable party linkages to large groups of the electorate. He contends that legislative logrolls leading to high protection are significantly less likely when parties are centralized. Furthermore, because parties with stable connections to the electorate have longer time horizons, the author argues that they will generally support more open trade policies that provide long-run economic benefits. Finally, he contends that parties linked to large electoral groups-as measured by district size-will prefer public goods such as freer trade over trade patronage. After coding a measure of party centralization developed by Cary and Shugart (1995), the author conducts a quantitative analysis of democracies from 1975-2000. His results support the theory and highlight an understudied institution in trade policy.},

  Abstract                 = { The elastic net procedure is a form of regularized optimization for linear regression that provides a bridge between ridge regression and the lasso. The estimate that it produces can be viewed as a Bayesian posterior mode under a prior distribution implied by the form of the elastic net penalty. This article broadens the scope of the Bayesian connection by providing a complete characterization of a class of prior distributions that generate the elastic net estimate as the posterior mode. The resulting model-based framework allows for methodology that moves beyond exclusive use of the posterior mode by considering inference based on the full posterior distribution. Two characterizations of the class of prior distributions are introduced: a properly normalized, direct characterization, which is shown to be conjugate for linear regression models, and an alternate representation as a scale mixture of normal distributions. Prior distributions are proposed for the regularization parameters, resulting in an infinite mixture of elastic net regression models that allows for adaptive, data-based shrinkage of the regression coefficients. Posterior inference is easily achieved using Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods. Uncertainty about model specification is addressed from a Bayesian perspective by assigning prior probabilities to all possible models. Corresponding computational approaches are described. Software for implementing the MCMC methods described in this article, written in C++ with an R package interface, is available at http://www.stat.osu.edu/~hans/software/. },

  Abstract                 = {A perennial complaint against U.S. multinational firms is one of Ãâexporting jobsÃâ: as they expand operations in their affiliates abroad, they simultaneously reduce activities in their parent operations in the United States. The implicit assumption in this charge is that foreign activities substitute for U.S. parent activities, such that going abroad necessarily means contracting at home. Though the claim that multinationals export jobs pervades the policy debate on globalization, there has been little academic research to assess its validity directly. Economic theory suggests that this simple view of multinationals is subject to at least two important caveats. One is a distinction between substitution and scale effects. The second important caveat is a distinction between scale and scope effects. Understanding the links between the foreign and domestic activities of U.S. multinationals is ultimately an empirical task. In this paper, we aim to provide this kind of evidence. Our data are a panel covering all U.S. multinational firmsÃâboth U.S. parents and foreign affiliates from 1989 through 1999Ãâas surveyed in legally mandated reports collected by the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA). One important finding is that we do not find strong evidence that foreign and parent labor are substitutes. Another finding is that reductions in host-country corporate tax rates do not reduce parent labor demand; if anything, such tax-rate reductions appear to increase parent labor demand.},

  Abstract                 = {This paper presents a statistical technique to estimate how the effects of political institutions on economic performance vary across different sets of circumstances. Recent work using a Schumpeterian growth paradigm (Aghion and Howitt, 2005) suggests that there exist different stages of economic growth and that the effect of any given set of institutions potentially varies across these stages. Catching up to the technological frontier, for example, requires that countries absorb and implement existing technologies, while continued growth at the technological frontier requires innovation of new technologies. Countries must shift from Ã¢â¬Åimplementation-enhancing institutionsÃ¢â¬ï¿½ to Ã¢â¬Åinnovation-enhancing institutionsÃ¢â¬ï¿½ in order to sustain growth. Additionally, there exists a third set of countries where institutions are so poor that neither implementation nor innovation takes place systematically. Use of this growth paradigm thus offers a method for developing context-dependent predictions concerning the relationships between political institutions and economic performance, representing a significant departure from typical approaches that apply a single economic growth model across all countries and times. Using a dataset covering 82 countries from 1960-2000, the statistical technique developed in this paper simultaneously estimates a separate set of coefficients on the key explanatory variables for each of these three stages of growth along with a weighting function that that indicates the extent to which each model applies to a particular country-year. The result is a much fuller description of the ways in which political institutions affect economic outcomes.},

  Abstract                 = {Principal-Agent (PA) theory has been used for over three decades to model the relationship between an information-advantaged Agent and a Principal able to issue a contract ultimatum. For its common implementation as a game, the subgame-perfect Nash equilibrium is reason- ably simple but generally wrong in predicting experimental or observational data. I implement PA theory theoretically and statistically as two kinds of strategic statistical models, then de- velop methods for testing competing behavioral hypotheses. I show that, whether one assumes deviations are based on agent error or random utility, subgame-perfect Nash equilibrium, risk aversion/affinity, and distributive justice/fairness theories are observationally distinct and specif- ically how they can be distinguished statistically.},

Our approach consists in reframing this task in a variable selection context. We use a penalized least-square criterion with a â1-type penalty for this purpose. We explain how to implement this method in practice by using the LARSâ/âLASSO algorithm. We then prove that, in an appropriate asymptotic framework, this method provides consistent estimators of the change points with an almost optimal rate. We finally provide an improved practical version of this method by combining it with a reduced version of the dynamic programming algorithm and we successfully compare it with classical methods. },

Based on a theoretical model, it empirically investigates the role of domestic political economy forces, international bargaining considerations, and the state of complementary policy. The empirical results confirm the relevance of the model in explaining banking and (to a somewhat lesser degree) securities services liberalization commitments. The findings imply that those who seek greater access to developing country markets for financial services must do more to counter protectionism at home in areas of export interest for developing countries.

Clustering is pervasive. Price clustering will occur if traders use discrete price sets to simplify their negotiations. Exchange regulations require that most stocks be traded on eighths. Clustering on larger fractions will occur if traders choose to use discrete price sets based on quarters, halves, or whole numbers. An econometric model of clustering is derived and estimated. Projections from the results suggest that traders would frequently use odd sixteenths when trading low-price stocks, if exchange regulations permitted trading on sixteenths.},

Any equilibrium point inG, whether it is in pure or in mixed strategies, can ÃÂ¢Ãâ¬ÃÅalmost alwaysÃÂ¢Ãâ¬Ãï¿½ be obtained as a limit of a pure-strategy equilibrium point in the corresponding disturbed gameG* when all disturbances go to zero. Accordingly, mixed-strategy equilibrium points are stable ÃÂ¢Ãâ¬Ãâ even though the players may make no deliberate effort to use their pure strategies with the probability weights prescribed by their mixed equilibrium strategies ÃÂ¢Ãâ¬Ãâ because the random fluctuations in their payoffs willmake them use their pure strategies approximately with the prescribed probabilities.},

Two cases have been distinguished: consistent games in which there exists some basic probability distribution from which the players' subjective probability distributions can be derived as conditional probability distributions; and inconsistent games in which no such basic probability distribution exists. Part III will now show that in consistent games, where a basic probability distribution exists, it is essentially unique. It will also be argued that, in the absence of special reasons to the contrary, one should try to analyze any given game situation with incomplete information in terms of a consistent-game model. However, it will be shown that our theory can be extended also to inconsistent games, in case the situation does require the use of an inconsistent-game model.},

  Abstract                 = {Part I of this paper has described a new theory for the analysis of games with incomplete information. It has been shown that, if the various players' subjective probability distributions satisfy a certain mutual-consistency requirement, then any given game with incomplete information will be equivalent to a certain game with complete information, called the "Bayes-equivalent" of the original game, or briefly a "Bayesian game." Part II of the paper will now show that any Nash equilibrium point of this Bayesian game yields a "Bayesian equilibrium point" for the original game and conversely. This result will then be illustrated by numerical examples, representing two-person zero-sum games with incomplete information. We shall also show how our theory enables us to analyze the problem of exploiting the opponent's erroneous beliefs. However, apart from its indubitable usefulness in locating Bayesian equilibrium points, we shall show it on a numerical example (the Bayes-equivalent of a two-person cooperative game) that the normal form of a Bayesian game is in many cases a highly unsatisfactory representation of the game situation and has to be replaced by other representations (e.g., by the semi-normal form). We shall argue that this rather unexpected result is due to the fact that Bayesian games must be interpreted as games with "delayed commitment" whereas the normal-form representation always envisages a game with "immediate commitment."},

  Abstract                 = {The paper develops a new theory for the analysis of games with incomplete information where the players are uncertain about some important parameters of the game situation, such as the payoff functions, the strategies available to various players, the information other players have about the game, etc. However, each player has a subjective probability distribution over the alternative possibilities. In most of the paper it is assumed that these probability distributions entertained by the different players are mutually "consistent", in the sense that they can be regarded as conditional probability distributions derived from a certain "basic probability distribution" over the parameters unknown to the various players. But later the theory is extended also to cases where the different players' subjective probability distributions fail to satisfy this consistency assumption. In cases where the consistency assumption holds, the original game can be replaced by a game where nature first conducts a lottery in accordance with the basic probablity distribution, and the outcome of this lottery will decide which particular subgame will be played, i.e., what the actual values of the relevant parameters will be in the game. Yet, each player will receive only partial information about the outcome of the lottery, and about the values of these parameters. However, every player will know the "basic probability distribution" governing the lottery. Thus, technically, the resulting game will be a game with complete information. It is called the Bayes-equivalent of the original game. Part I of the paper describes the basic model and discusses various intuitive interpretations for the latter. Part II shows that the Nash equilibrium points of the Bayes-equivalent game yield "Bayesian equilibrium points" for the original game. Finally, Part III considers the main properties of the "basic probablity distribution".},

  Abstract                 = {Principals, such as voters or districts, typically beneÃ¢â¬Â¦t by strategically delegat- ing their bargaining and voting power to representatives diÃÂ¤erent from themselves. There are conflicting views in the literature, however, of whether such a delegate should be "conservative" (status quo biased) or instead "progressive" relative to his electorate. I show how the answer depends on the political system in general and the majority requirement in particular. A larger majority requirement leads to "conservative" delegation and hence a status-quo bias, but optimal delegation is always achieved by the appropriate voting rule. The model is simple and can be employed, for example, to compare decentralization and centralization.},

  Abstract                 = {Abstract This article addresses the question of validating the homogeneous Lanchestrian square law of attrition by the use of historical data (and by extension, other attrition models). Validating an attrition model means testing that model against reality. In this case, Lanchester's square law is tested against the data from the Inchon-Seoul campaign of the Korean War. The data are examined using three analysis techniques: linear regression, the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC), and Bozdogan's Consistent AIC (CAIC). The data do not fit the assumption of a single, constant coefficient, homogeneous square law battle. The data do fit a set of three such battles (a new one every six or seven days); however, the data fit three constant-casualty-model battles just as well. The homogeneous Lanchester square law cannot be regarded as a proven attrition algorithm for warfare; however, the square law cannot be regarded as disproved either. Data on more battles are required to validate the square law or any other proposed attrition law.

This paper examines some of the complexity of the Helmbold ratio using analytical and simulation techniques and demonstrates that a constraint model of attrition captures some aspects of historical data. The effect that the constraint model would have on warfare modeling is uncertain, However, some speculation has been attempted concerning its use in large scale simulations. },

  Abstract                 = {This paper is the fourth in a series of reports on the breakthrough research in historical validation of attrition in conflict. Significant defense policy decisions, including weapons acquisition and arms reduction, are based in part on models of conflict. Most of these models are driven by their attrition algorithms, usually forms of the Lanchester square and linear laws. None of these algorithms have been validated. The results of this paper confirm the results of earlier papers, using a large database of historical results. The homogeneous linear-logarithmic Lanchestrian attrition model is validated to the extent possible with current initial and final force size data and is consistent with the Iwo Jima data. A particular differential linear-logarithmic model is described that fits the data very well. A version of Helmbold's victory predicting parameter is also confirmed, with an associated probability function. The implications of these findings are potentially far-reaching. Two-sided daily attrition data on a large number of battles is needed to absolutely confirm these results. Such a confirmation will require that numerous computer conflict models containing square and linear law based attrition algorithms be reexamined. It is conceivable that complex mixed, heterogeneous, square plus linear law algorithms may produce the same results as a homogeneous mixed linear-logarithmic law algorithm; however, such an occurrence is by no means assured. Even without such absolute confirmation, the results of this research allow the analysis of combat data for the effects of training, weather, leadership, and other human factors, unencumbered by the force size effects.},

  Abstract                 = {This paper looks at unobserved components models and examines the implied weighting patterns for signal extraction. There are four main themes. The first concerns the implications of correlated disturbances driving the components, especially those cases in which the correlation is perfect. The second is about the way in which ARIMA-based methods for trend extraction relate to those based on unobserved components. The third explores the impact of heteroscedasticity and irregular spacing and shows how setting up models with t-distributed disturbances leads to weighting patterns which are robust to outliers and breaks. Finally, a comparison is made between implied weighting patterns with kernels used in non-parametric trend estimation and equivalent kernels used in spline smoothing. It is demonstrated that with irregularly spaced data, the weighting used by conventional spline smoothing techniques is not the same as that obtained from the time series model based approach.},

They can often yield information that is less apparent from the innovations, but they suffer from the disadvantage that they are serially correlated even in a correctly specified model with known parameters. This article shows how the properties of the auxiliary residuals may be obtained, how they are related to each other and to the innovations, and how they can be used to construct test statistics.

This enables prior notions about the duration of cycles to be used, while the generalized class of stochastic cycles employed allows the possibility of relatively smooth cycles being extracted. The posterior distributions of such underlying cycles can be very informative for policy makers, particularly with regard to the size and direction of the output gap and potential turning points. From the technical point of view a contribution is made in investigating the most appropriate prior distributions for the parameters in the cyclical components and in developing Markov chain Monte Carlo methods for both univariate and multivariate models. Applications to \{US\} macroeconomic series are presented. },

  Abstract                 = {This paper traces the historical developments of the efforts to find simple and accurate methods of approximating an annuity's implicit yield and a bond's yield to maturity. It is shown that the little known history of yield approximations is nevertheless very rich, with contributions dating as far back as the late seventeenth century. It is also shown that the standard textbook approximation formula for the bond's yield to maturity is the least accurate of a large family of formulas, some of which were suggested as early as 1855.},

  Abstract                 = {Spatial interdependence, the interdependence of outcomes across units, is theoretically and substantively ubiquitous and central across the social sciences. The empirical association, correlation, or clustering of outcomes on some dimension(s), spatial association, is also obvious in most contexts. However, outcomes may exhibit spatial association for three distinct reasons. First, units may be responding similarly to similar exposure to similar exogenous internal/domestic or external/foreign stimuli (common exposure); second, unitsâ responses may depend on othersâ responses (contagion). A third possibility arises when the putative outcome affects the variable along which clustering occurs (selection: e.g., homophily). Severe empirical difficulties confront the accurate estimation and distinction of these alternative sources of spatial association. After brief review of specification, estimation, testing, and interpretation of the spatial and spatiotemporal autoregressive (SAR and STAR) models, which reflect interdependence directly and so can address Galtonâs Problem of distinguishing common exposure from contagion as alternative substantive sources of observed spatial association, this paper extends those analyses, proposing the multiparametric spatiotemporal autoregressive (m-STAR) model as a simple approach to estimating jointly the pattern of connectivity and the strength of contagion by that pattern, including the case where connectivity is endogenous to the dependent variable (i.e., selection).** We again stress substantively-theoretically guided (i.e., structural) specifications that can support analyses of estimated spatiotemporal responses to stochastic or covariate shocks and that can distinguish the possible sources of spatial association, now three: common exposure, contagion, and selection. In addition to discussing estimation of m-STAR models, this paper compares the approach to extant longitudinal-network strategies,** and suggests how to calculate, interpret, and present the dynamic, endogenous coevolution of network structure and of contagion and common-exposure effects that emerges from such a system of nonlinear endogenous equations. We illustrate this approach to dynamic, endogenous interdependenceâwhich parallels models of network and behavior coevolution in the dynamic or longitudinal networks literatureâwith an empirical application attempting to disentangle the roles of economic interdependence, correlated external and internal stimuli, EU co- membership, and geographic proximity in shaping labor-market policies in recent years.},

The marked decrease in the incidence of conflicts in the 1990s was mostly due to a high number of conflict terminations, not to a decrease in the number of new wars. The articles in this special issue treat theoretically and empirically the determinants of civil war onset, duration, and termination, with particular emphasis on duration and termination. This introduction gives an overview of the articles in the special issue and discusses a few central topics covered by the different contributions: rebel group motivations, the importance of financing, military factors, misperception, and commitment problems. Finally, the article sums up some policy recommendations that may be derived from the articles in the issue.},

  Abstract                 = {In the literature on civil war onset, several empirical results are not robust or replicable across studies. Studies use different definitions of civil war and analyze different time periods, so readers cannot easily determine if differences in empirical results are due to those factors or if most empirical results are just not robust. The authors apply a methodology for organized specification tests to check the robustness of empirical results. They isolate causes of variation in empirical results by using the same definition of civil war and analyzing the same time period while systematically exploring the sensitivity of eighty-eight variables used to explain civil war in the literature. Several relationships with the onset of civil wars prove robust: large population and low income levels, low rates of economic growth, recent political instability and inconsistent democratic institutions, small military establishments and rough terrain, and war-prone and undemocratic neighbors. Variables representing ethnic difference in the population are robust only in relation to lower level armed conflict.},

While recent work in economic voting has made strides in accounting for the contextual mediators of support, analyses have not gone beyond domestic political structures. At the same time, students of globalization highlight the constraints governments face from the world economy but do not extend their analyses to examine the role of mass political behavior. This article brings these two research agendas together. Using cross-sectional individual-level data, it is found that accounting for exposure to the world economy dampens the strength of domestic economic bases of popular support. Additional analyses show that the susceptibility of different groups in society to the global economy's mediating influences is not uniform but contingent on occupational differences.},

A relationship between the activity ratio and the initial force ratio has been developed for historical land battles. Statistics are based on a sample of 92 historical land combat battles, most of which took place during the 19th century. Using data on the Battle of Britain (which was fought entirely in the air), it is shown that this battle obeyed the same relation between activity ratio and initial force ratio as did the land battles examined. It is possible that the same pattern of dependency is a general characteristic of all armed combat. On the basis of the data now on hand, it is at least a reasonable hypothesis that should be tested further by the collection and analysis of additional data. If the pattern proves applicable in combat situations, it would be of great importance to the understanding of combat dynamics.},

  Abstract                 = {We develop a simple model of international trade with heterogeneous firms that is consistent with a number of stylized features of the data. In particular, the model predicts positive as well as zero trade flows across pairs of countries, and it allows the number of exporting firms to vary across destination countries. As a result, the impact of trade frictions on trade flows can be decomposed into the intensive and extensive margins, where the former refers to the trade volume per exporter and the latter refers to the number of exporters. This model yields a generalized gravity equation that accounts for the self-selection of firms into export markets and their impact on trade volumes. We then develop a two-stage estimation procedure that uses a selection equation into trade partners in the first stage and a trade flow equation in the second. We implement this procedure parametrically, semi-parametrically, and non-parametrically, showing that in all three cases the estimated effects of trade frictions are similar. Importantly, our method provides estimates of the intensive and extensive margins of trade. We show that traditional estimates are biased, and that most of the bias is not due to selection but rather due to the omission of the extensive margin. Moreover, the effect of the number of exporting firms varies across country pairs according to their characteristics. This variation is large, and particularly so for trade between developed and less developed countries and between pairs of less developed countries.},

We develop tests of rational and equilibrium bidding in a common values model that are implemented using data on bids and ex post values. We also use data on tract location and ex post values to test the comparative static prediction that bidders may bid less aggressively in common value auctions when they expect more competition.

  Abstract                 = {Some theories of foreign economic policy stress the importance of domestic interest groups, whereas others focus on the effects of domestic institutions. Debates between advocates of these approaches are longstanding, but little systematic empirical research has been brought to bear on the relative merits of these theories. We argue that while interest group demands and institutions are often regarded as having independent and competing effects, it is more fruitful to view the influence of each type of factor as conditional on the other. As explanations emphasizing societal interests contend, deteriorating macroeconomic conditions are a potent source of protectionist sentiment. The extent to which such conditions reduce commercial openness, however, depends centrally on a country's political institutions, especially the number of veto points in a country's policy-making structure and its regime type. We expect the effects of macroeconomic conditions on trade policy to become weaker as the number of veto points increases. We also expect both veto points and the societal pressures stemming from the economy to have a more potent impact on trade policy in democracies than in other regimes. The results of our statistical tests covering almost 60 countries during the period from 1980 to 2000 strongly support these arguments.},

  Abstract                 = {Existing explanations of European monetary integration, emphasizing economic interdependence, issue linkage, institutions, and domestic politics, take a predominantly regional approach. In the international monetary thesis developed here, I argue that U.S. policy disturbances, transmitted through the international monetary system, created compelling incentives for European states to cooperate on exchange-rate and monetary policy. I develop a general theory of macroeconomic power, based on open economy macroeconomics, and show how the exercise of such influence can drive regional monetary integration. This article then tests the international thesis with reference to monetary integration within the European Union by examining four periods in which the United States acted to stabilize the international monetary system and seven episodes in which it disrupted the system. European governments and central banks reduced regional monetary cooperation when the United States supported system stability and strengthened it after each episode of disruption. The evidence thus strongly supports the inference that the link is causal.},

These problems often arise from a non-smooth objective function with large flat areas, the discontinuity of the CES function where the elasticity of substitution is one, and possibly significant rounding errors where the elasticity of substitution is close to one. We suggest three (combinable) solutions that alleviate these problems and improve the reliability and stability of the results.},

Furthermore, we demonstrate how these approaches can be applied in R using the add-on package micEconCES and we describe how the various estimation approaches are implemented in the micEconCES package. Finally, we illustrate the usage of this package by replicating some estimations of CES functions that are reported in the literature.},

  Abstract                 = {As global demand for water increases but usable freshwater resources decrease, many have suggested that water scarcity is and will be an important source of armed conflict -- but little systematic research has investigated this topic. We examine the management of all shared rivers in the Americas, Western Europe, and the Middle East, seeking to understand both the outbreak of explicit disagreements over the use of rivers ("river claims") and the militarization of these claims. We argue that increasing water scarcity and water demands make states more likely to begin river claims and to begin militarized conflict over these claims, but that treaties can help to prevent both the emergence and militarization of river claims. Empirical analysis with rare events logit models indicates that greater levels of water scarcity and greater demands on water increase the risk of both claim onset and militarization, while river treaties have mixed effects on claim onset but significantly reduce militarization. We conclude by discussing implications for future research in this area.},

  Abstract                 = {This paper builds on a large literature that explores the linkages between resource scarcity and interstate conflict. Focusing on competing claims over cross-border rivers, we analyze peaceful and militarized techniques used by states to manage river claims, and compare the success of these techniques for resolving the issues under contention. We focus on two key factors to account for variance in the use and effectiveness of conflict management strategies: water scarcity and institutions. We argue that high levels of water scarcity increase the frequency of explicit claims over fresh water, increase the chances of militarized conflict over these claims, and make it more difficult for conflict management institutions to be created or to be effective. We also examine the role of peace-promoting institutions, both river-specific and general institutions, arguing that institutional membership should promote peaceful attempts to resolve river claims. Analyzing data on river claims (1900-2001) from the Issue Correlates of War (ICOW) Project, we find that greater water scarcity increases the likelihood of both militarized conflict and peaceful third party settlement attempts, while river-specific institutions reduce militarized conflict and increase the effectiveness of peaceful settlement attempts.

Such reshufflings suggest that legislative politics in Illinois are conducted in a manner consistent with vote-buying theories of coalition formation.},

  Abstract                 = {World trade has grown exponentially during the last 60 years. Admittedly, it is not clear if this development can be assigned to international trade agreements like the World Trade Organization or the Generalized System of Preferences as previous empirical studies found contradicting results. In this paper we generalize the different approaches used in the literature to estimate the role of {GATT}/WTO and the Generalized System of Preferences for trade. We use a gravity model and apply FE estimation on a disaggregated bilateral data set of the trade flows between 145 countries across 1962-99. In our analysis we find a significant positive effect of WTO membership on bilateral trade. Referring to other multilateral institutions, we find robust evidence that membership in regional trade agreements or currency unions substantially increase bilateral trade flows as well. By contrast, we find that the Generalized System of Preferences does not foster trade in general, rather the opposite. This might be due to the opportunistic behavior of industrial countries that grant GSP schemes as long as the concerned products are relatively unimportant, but restrict them as soon as they become relevant.},

  Abstract                 = {War, whether external or internal, large or small, is a costly endeavor. Loss of life, loss of close friends or family, and the destruction of material possessions all play a part in the costs of war. The purpose of this paper is to capture only the material, economic welfare costs of conflict stemming from the altered path of consumption resulting from conflict. As such, the measure is quite a lower bound for the true and more encompassing welfare loss from living in a non-peaceful world. But how much would individual be willing to pay to avoid just the economic costs of conflict? Remarkably, even these pure economic welfare losses from conflict are quite large. I find that, on average, individuals who live in a country that has experienced some conflict during the 1960-1992 sample would permanently give up to approximately 8 percent of their current level of consumption to live in a purely peaceful world. Such large potential welfare gains from reducing warfare should make economists and policy-makers take note, and continue to investigate and advocate for domestic and international institutions to realize such gains.},

  Abstract                 = {This study examines postwar patterns in macroeconomic policies and outcomes associated with left- and right-wing governments in capitalist democracies. It argues that the objective economic interests as well as the subjective preferences of lower income and occupational status groups are best served by a relatively low unemployment-high inflation macroeconomic configuration, whereas a comparatively high unemployment-low inflation configuration is compatible with the interests and preferences of upper income and occupational status groups. Highly aggregated data on unemployment and inflation outcomes in relation to the political orientation of governments in 12 West European and North American nations are analyzed revealing a low unemployment-high inflation configuration in nations regularly governed by the Left and a high unemployment-low inflation pattern in political systems dominated by center and rightist parties. Finally, time-series analyses of quarterly postwar unemployment data for the United States and Great Britain suggests that the unemployment rate has been driven downward by Democratic and Labour administrations and upward by Republican and Conservative governments. The general conclusion is that governments pursue macroeconomic policies broadly in accordance with the objective economic interests and subjective preferences of their class-defined core political constituencies.},

Pooled time series analyses of welfare effort in 18 nations during the 1960-82 period show that electoral turnout, as well as left and center governments increase welfare effort; that the welfare efforts of governments led by particular types of parties show significant differences and vary notably with the strength of oppositional (and junior coalitional) parties; and that relatively neocorporatist, centralized, and traditionalistic polities are high on welfare effort. Overall, our findings suggest that contrary to many claims, both partisan and nonpartisan facets of democratic politics and political institutions shape contemporary social welfare effort.},

Empirically, countries move through the product space by developing goods close to those they currently produce. Most countries can reach the core only by traversing empirically infrequent distances, which may help explain why poor countries have trouble developing more competitive exports and fail to converge to the income levels of rich countries.},

Conventional metrics like the growth rate of house prices, the price-to-rent ratio, and the price-to-income ratio can be misleading because they fail to account both for the time series pattern of real long-term interest rates and predictable differences in the long-run growth rates of house prices across local markets. These factors are especially important in recent years because house prices are theoretically more sensitive to interest rates when rates are already low, and more sensitive still in those cities where the long-run rate of house price growth is high. During the 1980s, our measures show that houses looked most overvalued in many of the same cities that subsequently experienced the largest house price declines. We find that from the trough of 1995 to 2004, the cost of owning rose somewhat relative to the cost of renting, but not, in most cities, to levels that made houses look overvalued.},

Clinton (2007) argues that conventional empirical tests of pivot models using ideal point estimates such as DW-NOMINATE are inappropriate, due to the endogeneity of ideal point estimates to the theory. Monte Carlo simulations in this paper demonstrate that if legislators are modeled as voting via a unidimensional spatial model augmented with random utility shocks, the ideal points of all legislators, as well as accurate estimates of the gridlock interval width, can be recovered. Moreover, any bias in second stage regressions arising from ideal point endogeneity will result in attenuated coefficients, and is likely to be minor for real Congressional data. My analysis thus reaffirms the validity of conventional tests of pivot theories, and demonstrates an alternative methodology for accommodating the endogeneity of ideal point estimates to theories of lawmaking.},

Analogous to the familiar technology of production and exchange is the technology of conflict and struggle, applicable not only to military combat but also in domains such as redistributive politics, strikes and lockouts, litigation, and crime. The conflict success function (CSF) takes as inputs the fighting efforts on the two sides and generates as outputs the respective degrees of success achieved. A crucial determinant of the outcome is the decisiveness parameter, which scales the degree to which force preponderance translates into differential success. Because success feeds on success, in the long run a hegemonic outcome is likely unless the decisiveness parameter is relatively low. The CSF can be adjusted to distinguish between offense and defense, allow for geography and organization, or even display how intangible considerations such as truth or morality can promote success.},

  Abstract                 = {The rent-seeking competitions studied by economists fall within a much broader category of conflict interactions that also includes military combats, election campaigns, industrial disputes, lawsuits, and sibling rivalries. In the rent-seeking literature, each party's success pi (which can be interpreted either as the probability of victory or as the proportion of the prize won) has usually been taken to be a function of the ratio of the respective resource commitments. Alternatively, however, pi may instead be a function of the difference between the parties' commitments to the contest. The Contest Success Function (CSF) for the difference from is a logistic curve in which, as is consistent with military experience, increasing returns apply up to an inflection point at equal resource commitments. A crucial flaw of the traditional ratio model is that neither onesided submission nor two-sided peace between the parties can ever occur as a Cournot equilibrium. In contrast, both of these outcomes are entirely consistent with a model in which success is a function of the difference between the parties' resource commitments.},

  Abstract                 = {Domestic political conflict has been a constant companion to international trade, but the nature of that conflict has varied greatly in Western democracies over the last two centuries. Political battles over trade policy appear to have sometimes divided societies along broad class lines and at other times split them into narrow industry-based coalitions. I argue that this diversity stems from historical and cross-national variation in inter-industry factor mobility. Class coalitions are more likely where factor mobility is high, whereas narrow, industry-based coalitions are more likely where mobility is low. Evidence from six Western economies for the last two centuries indicates that levels of factor mobility have varied historically and cross-nationally in accord with industrialization and regulation. This variation corresponds broadly with observable differences in the formation of trade policy coalitions.},

The analysis starts by comparing the ideal point estimates produced by three `inductive' techniques: exploratory factor analysis, NOMINATE and Optimal Classification. The results are a series of ideal point estimates that do not correlate well with some simple a priori assumptions about key actors' positions on the reform of the EU. The analysis then proceeds with a `mixed' deductive/inductive method, in which responses to the survey questions relating to the two exogenous dimensions of constitutional design in a multi-level polity (the `vertical' and `horizontal' allocation of power) are used to generate ideal point estimates on these two dimensions. The result is a more intuitive set of ideal point estimates for the 28 main actors in the negotiations.},

  Abstract                 = {Presidential and congressional influence over regulatory agencies forms a central topic in the study of bureaucratic politics and administrative law. One mechanism of congressional con- trol consists of formal constraints on the president's appointment power: enabling statutes for independent regulatory commissions often cap the number of same-party (party-line) commissioners a president may appoint, forcing presidents to appoint cross-party commissioners. This paper provides the first systematic empirical evidence on the impact of partisan require- ments. I present evidence from a new dataset of published adjudications and rulemakings in the Federal Communications Commission from 1965--2006. This dataset is the largest and most complete ever assembled, documenting 94, 693 votes by 46 commissioners in 17, 879 adjudications and rulemakings. Using a Bayesian multilevel ideal point model for mixed ordinal votes, I find that partisan requirements may have considerable effects on substantive policy outcomes. The evidence squarely rejects theories of presidential dominance in the appointments game. But effects are in part unanticipated: evidence suggests that after 1980, cross-party appointees are even more extreme than party-line appointees, pointing to a sharp rupture in Senatorial deference in the 1980s.},

  Abstract                 = {Although published works rarely include causal estimates from more than a few model specifications, authors usually choose the presented estimates from numerous trial runs readers never see. Given the often large variation in estimates across choices of control variables, functional forms, and other modeling assumptions, how can researchers ensure that the few estimates presented are accurate or representative? How do readers know that publications are not merely demonstrations that it is possible to find a specification that fits the author's favorite hypothesis? And how do we evaluate or even define statistical properties like unbiasedness or mean squared error when no unique model or estimator even exists? Matching methods, which offer the promise of causal inference with fewer assumptions, constitute one possible way forward, but crucial results in this fast-growing methodological literature are often grossly misinterpreted. We explain how to avoid these misinterpretations and propose a unified approach that makes it possible for researchers to preprocess data with matching (such as with the easy-to-use software we offer) and then to apply the best parametric techniques they would have used anyway. This procedure makes parametric models produce more accurate and considerably less model-dependent causal inferences.},

The present study investigated whether the SSS cross-validates with performance on mental tasks and whether the SSS demonstrates changes in sleepiness with sleep loss. Five college student Ss were given a brief test of memory and the Wilkinson Addition Test in 2 test sessions and The Wilkinson Vigilance Test in 2 other sessions spaced throughout a 16-hr day for 6 days. Ss made SSS ratings every 15 min during their waking activities. On night 4, Ss underwent all night sleep deprivation. On all other nights, Ss were allowed only 8 hrs in bed. Mean SSS ratings correlated r= .68 with performance on the Wilkinson Tests. Discrete SSS ratings correlated r= .47 with performance on the memory test. Moreover, mean baseline SSS ratings were found to be significantly lower than corresponding ratings of the deprivation period.},

  Abstract                 = {Since the mid 1980s a substantial amount of research has been undertaken on trade in services. Much of this is inspired by the World Trade Organization or regional trade agreements, especially the European Union, but an increasing number of papers focus on the impacts of services sector liberalization. This paper surveys the literature, focusing on contributions that investigate the determinants of international trade and investment in services, the potential gains from greater trade (and liberalization), and efforts to cooperate to achieve such liberalization through trade agreements. It concludes that there is increasing evidence that services liberalization is an important source of potential welfare gains, but relatively little research has been done that can inform the design of international cooperation - both trade agreements and development assistance - so as to more effectively promote development objectives.},

  Abstract                 = {We argue that the standard methodology for assessing the impact of Supreme Court decisions on public opinion, which relies on national surveys to measure public attitudes before and after relevant Court decisions, fails, among other grounds, to account for the fact that the overwhelming majority of Court decisions speak to particular constituencies only. We assess the impact of the Supreme Court's decision in Lamb's Chapel v. Center Moriches on the geographic constituencies involved in the case. We interviewed a random sample of residents in the town of Center Moriches and in the surrounding county of Suffolk, New York, before and after the decision. Consistent with the elaboration likelihood model of persuasion (Petty and Cacioppo 1986), we find that high levels of information about the decision increases support for the Court's decision among those for whom the decision is relatively less salient.},

The n-input approximation is, as for n = 2, a translog function, but with more complex restrictions on the translog parameters. Bias and consistency of the Taylor approximation to the n-input CES function are discussed, and it is argued that the approximation will only give reliable results for a limited regime of CES parameters and input values. A test of CES structure of the n-input translog function is performed for the fleet of Danish trawlers operating in the North Sea from 1987ÃâÃâ99.},

  Abstract                 = {Network models are widely used to represent relational information among interacting units. In studies of social networks, recent emphasis has been placed on random graph models where the nodes usually represent individual social actors and the edges represent the presence of a specified relation between actors. We develop a class of models where the probability of a relation between actors depends on the positions of individuals in an unobserved &quot;social space.&quot; We make inference for the social space within maximum likelihood and Bayesian frameworks, and propose Markov chain Monte Carlo procedures for making inference on latent positions and the effects of observed covariates. We present analyses of three standard datasets from the social networks literature, and compare the method to an alternative stochastic blockmodeling approach. In addition to improving on model fit for these datasets, our method provides a visual and interpretable model-based spatial representation of social relationships and improves on existing methods by allowing the statistical uncertainty in the social space to be quantified and graphically represented.},

  Abstract                 = {Despite the desire to focus on the interconnected nature of politics and economics at the global scale, most empirical studies in the field of international relations assume not only that the major actors are sovereign, but also that their relationships are portrayed in data that are modeled as independent phenomena. In contrast, this article illustrates the use of linear and bilinear random-effects models to represent statistical dependencies that often characterize dyadic data such as international relations. In particular, we show how to estimate models for dyadic data that simultaneously take into account: (a) regressor variables, (b) correlation of actions having the same actor, (c) correlation of actions having the same target, (d) correlation of actions between a pair of actors (i.e., reciprocity of actions), and (e) third-order dependencies, such as transitivity, clustering, and balance. We apply this new approach to the political relations among a wide range of political actors in Central Asia over the period 1989-1999, illustrating the presence and strength of second- and third-order statistical dependencies in these data.},

  Abstract                 = {Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC) is a Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithm that avoids the random walk behavior and sensitivity to correlated parameters that plague many MCMC methods by taking a series of steps informed by first-order gradient information. These features allow it to converge to high-dimensional target distributions much more quickly than simpler methods such as random walk Metropolis or Gibbs sampling. However, HMC's performance is highly sensitive to two user-specified parameters: a step size {\epsilon} and a desired number of steps L. In particular, if L is too small then the algorithm exhibits undesirable random walk behavior, while if L is too large the algorithm wastes computation. We introduce the No-U-Turn Sampler (NUTS), an extension to HMC that eliminates the need to set a number of steps L. NUTS uses a recursive algorithm to build a set of likely candidate points that spans a wide swath of the target distribution, stopping automatically when it starts to double back and retrace its steps. Empirically, NUTS perform at least as efficiently as and sometimes more efficiently than a well tuned standard HMC method, without requiring user intervention or costly tuning runs. We also derive a method for adapting the step size parameter {\epsilon} on the fly based on primal-dual averaging. NUTS can thus be used with no hand-tuning at all. NUTS is also suitable for applications such as BUGS-style automatic inference engines that require efficient "turnkey" sampling algorithms.},

  Abstract                 = {Studies of bloc voting in the United Nations have appeared periodically since the early 1960s. This article examines the evolution of UN voting in its first four decades using multidimensional scaling, which is compared to factor analysis and found to be superior for representation and interpretation. UN voting is important for showing how world politics is reflected in that body, hence the frequent use of UN votes as a dependent variable in the analysis of foreign policy behaviour.},

The vastness and precise time resolution of an Internet community offers unique possibilities to monitor social network formation and dynamics. Time evolution of well-known quantities, such as clustering, mixing (degree-degree correlations), average geodesic length, degree, and reciprocity is studied. In contrast to earlier analyses of scientific collaboration networks, mixing by degree between vertices is found to be disassortative. Furthermore, both the evolutionary trajectories of the average geodesic length and of the clustering coefficients are found to have minima.},

  Abstract                 = {Applications of modern methods for analyzing data with missing values, based primarily on multiple imputation, have in the last half-decade become common in American politics and political behavior. Scholars in this subset of political science have thus increasingly avoided the biases and inefficiencies caused by ad hoc methods like listwise deletion and best guess imputation. However, researchers in much of comparative politics and international relations, and others with similar data, have been unable to do the same because the best available imputation methods work poorly with the time-series cross-section data structures common in these fields. We attempt to rectify this situation with three related developments. First, we build a multiple imputation model that allows smooth time trends, shifts across cross-sectional units, and correlations over time and space, resulting in far more accurate imputations. Second, we enable analysts to incorporate knowledge from area studies experts via priors on individual missing cell values, rather than on difficult-to-interpret model parameters. Third, because these tasks could not be accomplished within existing imputation algorithms, in that they cannot handle as many variables as needed even in the simpler cross-sectional data for which they were designed, we also develop a new algorithm that substantially expands the range of computationally feasible data types and sizes for which multiple imputation can be used. These developments also make it possible to implement the methods introduced here in freely available open source software that is considerably more reliable than existing algorithms.},

First, we construct an econometric model of an auction in which bidders' preferences have both common- and private-value components, and propose a new monotone quantile approach which facilitates estimation of this model. Second, we estimate the model using bids from procurement auctions held by the State of New Jersey. For a large subset of these auctions, we find that median procurement costs rise as competition intensifies. In this setting, then, asymmetric information overturns the common economic wisdom that more competition is always desirable.},

That statistical significance is not economic significance is a banal and uncontroversial claim, and there is no convincing evidence that economists systematically mistake the two. Other elements of McCloskeyÃâs analysis of statistical significance are shown to be ill-founded, and her criticisms of practices of economists are found to be based in inaccurate readings and tendentious interpretations of their work.},

  Abstract                 = {We develop two methods of automated content analysis that give approximately unbiased estimates of quantities of theoretical interest to social scientists. With a small sample of documents hand coded into investigator-chosen categories, our methods can give accurate estimates of the proportion of text documents in each category in a larger population. Existing methods successful at maximizing the percent of documents correctly classified allow for the possibility of substantial estimation bias in the category proportions of interest. Our first approach corrects this bias for any existing classifier, with no additional assumptions. Our second method estimates the proportions without the intermediate step of individual document classification, and thereby greatly reduces the required assumptions. For both methods, we also correct statistically, apparently for the first time, for the far less-than-perfect levels of inter-coder reliability that typically characterize human attempts to classify documents, an approach that will normally outperform even population hand coding when that is feasible. We illustrate these methods by tracking the daily opinions of millions of people about candidates for the 2008 presidential nominations in online blogs, data we introduce and make available with this article, and through evaluations in available corpora from other areas, including movie reviews, university web sites, and Enron emails. We also offer easy-to-use software that implements all methods described.},

It covers all 351 WTO disputes initiated through the official filing of a Request for Consultations from January 1, 1995, until October 25, 2006, and for these disputes it includes events occurring until December 31, 2006. Each dispute is followed through its legal life via the panel stage, the Appellate Body stage, through to the implementation stage. The descriptive statistics in the paper points to three observations. The first and obvious observation is the almost complete absence of least developed countries. Secondly, less poor developing countries are much more active, and much more successful than the authors would have expected. Third, the EU and the US dominate less than expected, being much more often the subject of complaints, than a complaining party, and they have a very low share of all panellists.},

  Abstract                 = {An English language self-assessment Morningness-Eveningness questionnaire is presented and evaluated against individual differences in the circadian vatiation of oral temperature. 48 subjects falling into Morning, Evening and Intermediate type categories regularly took their temperature. Circadian peak time were identified from the smoothed temperature curves of each subject. Results showed that Morning types and a significantly earlier peak time than Evening types and tended to have a higher daytime temperature and lower post peak temperature. The Intermediate type had temperatures between those of the other groups. Although no significant differences in sleep lengths were found between the three types, Morning types retired and arose significantly earlier than Evening types. Whilst these time significatly correlated with peak time, the questionnaire showed a higher peak time correlation. Although sleep habits are an important dÃ©terminant of peak time there are other contibutory factors, and these appear to be partly covered by the questionnaire. Although the questionnaire appears to be valid, further evaluation using a wider subject population is required.},

  Abstract                 = {The bootstrap is a method for estimating the distribution of an estimator or test statistic by resampling one's data or a model estimated from the data. Under conditions that hold in a wide variety of econometric applications, the bootstrap provides approximations to distributions of statistics, coverage probabilities of confidence intervals, and rejection probabilities of hypothesis tests that are more accurate than the approximations of first-order asymptotic distribution theory. The reductions in the differences between true and nominal coverage or rejection probabilities can be very large. The bootstrap is a practical technique that is ready for use in applications. This chapter explains and illustrates the usefulness and limitations of the bootstrap in contexts of interest in econometrics. The chapter outlines the theory of the bootstrap, provides numerical illustrations of its performance, and gives simple instructions on how to implement the bootstrap in applications. The presentation is informal and expository. Its aim is to provide an intuitive understanding of how the bootstrap works and a feeling for its practical value in econometrics.},

  Abstract                 = {In this article, the authors investigate the relationship between states'political leaders'ages, their regime type, and the likelihood of militarized dispute initiation and escalation. They examine more than 100,000 interstate dyads between 1875 and 2002 to systematically test the relationship between leader age and militarized disputes. The results show that, in general, as the age of leaders increases, they become more likely to both initiate and escalate militarized disputes. In addition, the interaction of age and regime type is significant. In personalist regimes, the general effect reverses; as age increases, the relative risk of conflict declines in comparison to other types of regimes. Increasing leader age in democracies increases the relative risk propensity for conflict initiation at a higher level than for personalist regimes, while the impact of increasing leader age is most substantial in intermediate regimes.},

  Abstract                 = { ABSTRACT Studies of terrorism in general and suicide terrorism in particular tend to view terrorist groups independently. However, what if the propensity for a terrorist group to adopt suicide tactics depends in part on its external linkages and the relationship between the organizational capabilities required to adopt the innovation and the organizational capabilities of the group? This article shows that the organizational change requirements for adopting an innovation significantly influence the overall adoption pattern, along with interlinkages between groups. Additionally, evaluating the universe of terrorist groups, not only those groups that adopted suicide terrorism but those that did not, shows that Pape's key variable of interest, occupation, does not significantly predict the adoption of suicide terrorism. Thinking about suicide terrorism as a special case of diffusion in the military areacan help bring the study of suicide terrorism further into the mainstream and highlight how the phenomenon has not just differences, but similarities, to other innovations. },

  Abstract                 = { ABSTRACT Policy-makers and the electorate assume political executives' life experiences affect their policy choices once in office. Recent international relations work on leaders focuses almost entirely on how political institutions shape leaders' choices rather than on leaders' personal attributes and how they influence policy choices. This article focuses the analytic lens on leaders and their personal backgrounds. We theorize that the prior military background of a leader is an important life experience with direct relevance for how leaders evaluate the utility of using military force. We test several propositions employing a new data set, building on Archigos, that encompasses the life background characteristics of more than 2,500 heads of state from 1875 to 2004. The results show that the leaders most likely to initiate militarized disputes and wars are those with prior military service but no combat experience, as well as former rebels. },

  Abstract                 = {This paper develops a new method for estimating the structural parameters of (discrete choice) dynamic programming problems. The method reduces the computational burden of estimating such models. We show the valuation functions characterizing the expected future utility associated with the choices often can be represented as an easily computed function of the state variables, structural parameters, and the probabilities of choosing alternative actions for states which are feasible in the future. Under certain conditions, nonparametric estimators of these probabilities can be formed from sample information on the relative frequencies of observed choices using observations with the same (or similar) state variables. Substituting the estimators for the true conditional choice probabilities in formulating optimal decision rules, we establish the consistency and asymptotic normality of the resulting structural parameter estimators. To illustrate our new method, we estimate a dynamic model of parental contraceptive choice and fertility using data from the National Fertility Survey.},

Empirically, however, these claims either rest on a small number of case studies or samples subject to severe selection bias. In this paper, I present a model showing that inequality does not systematically affect the probability that non-democracies transit to- ward democracy, but that, once established, equal democracies are unlikely to collapse. Using a Markov transition model and a dataset covering about 2400 country-years between 1950 and 2001, I indeed find that contrary to what the previous theoretical research has predicted inequality has no systematic effect on democratization. Inequality does, however, destabilize already established democracies.},

  Abstract                 = {Since the early 1960s, scholarly thinking on the power of U.S. presidents has rested on these words: "Presidential power is the power to persuade." Power, in this formulation, is strictly about bargaining and convincing other political actors to do things the president cannot accomplish alone.Power without Persuasionargues otherwise. Focusing on presidents' ability to act unilaterally, William Howell provides the most theoretically substantial and far-reaching reevaluation of presidential power in many years. He argues that presidents regularly set public policies over vocal objections by Congress, interest groups, and the bureaucracy. Throughout U.S. history, going back to the Louisiana Purchase and the Emancipation Proclamation, presidents have set landmark policies on their own. More recently, Roosevelt interned Japanese Americans during World War II, Kennedy established the Peace Corps, Johnson got affirmative action underway, Reagan greatly expanded the president's powers of regulatory review, and Clinton extended protections to millions of acres of public lands. Since September 11, Bush has created a new cabinet post and constructed a parallel judicial system to try suspected terrorists. Howell not only presents numerous new empirical findings but goes well beyond the theoretical scope of previous studies. Drawing richly on game theory and the new institutionalism, he examines the political conditions under which presidents can change policy without congressional or judicial consent. Clearly written,Power without Persuasionasserts a compelling new formulation of presidential power, one whose implications will resound.},

  Abstract                 = {Existing theories of legislative delegation to bureaucracies typically focus on a single legislature, often the U.S. Congress. We argue that this parochial focus has important limitations. If one contends that politicians respond rationally to their political environment when adopting strategies for controlling bureaucrats, then theories of control should be able to explain how differences in the political environment-and in particular in the democratic institutional arrangements that shape this environment-influence strategies for controlling bureaucrats. We offer such a theory about the conditions under which legislatures should rely on statutory control (i.e., detailed legislation) in order to limit the discretion of agencies. The theory focuses on the interactions of four factors: conflict between legislators and bureaucrats, the bargaining costs associated with choosing the institutions for controlling bureaucrats, the professional capacity of legislators to create institutions for control, and the impact of political institutions on the relative costs and benefits of statutory and nonstatutory strategies of control. We test our argument using legislation from 1995 and 1996 that affects Medicaid programs. The results show that legislatures are more likely to make use of statutory controls when control of government is divided between the two parties, the two chambers of the legislature are unified in their opposition to the executive, the legislature is more professionalized, and the legislature does not have easily available options for nonstatutory control.},

We test the relative explanatory power of these two theoretical approaches on the escalation of deterrence encounters among great powers from 1816 to 1984. We derive a set of hypotheses from each model, operationalize them for systematic empirical analysis, and test the hypotheses on 97 cases of great-power deterrence encounters by means of probit analysis. The results are that the hypotheses derived from deterrence theory receive considerable support, whereas none of the hypotheses derived from structural realism are supported.},

  Abstract                 = {We address a major discrepancy in matching methods for causal inference in observational data. Since these data are typically plentiful, the goal of matching is to reduce bias and only secondarily to keep variance low. However, most matching methods seem designed for the opposite problem, guaranteeing sample size ex ante but limiting bias by controlling for covariates through reductions in the imbalance between treated and control groups only ex post and only sometimes. (The resulting practical difficulty may explain why most published applications do not check whether imbalance was reduced and so may not even be decreasing bias.) We introduce a new class "Monotonic Imbalance Bounding" (MIB) matching methods that enables one to choose a fixed level of maximum imbalance, or to reduce maximum imbalance for one variable without changing the maximum imbalance for the others. We then discuss a specific MIB method called "Coarsened Exact Matching" (CEM) which, unlike most existing approaches, also explicitly bounds through ex ante user choice both the degree of model dependence and the treatment effect estimation error, eliminates the need for a separate procedure to restrict data to common support, meets the congruence principle, is robust to measurement error, works well with modern methods of imputation for missing data, is computationally efficient even with massive data sets, and is easy to understand and use. This method can improve causal inferences in a wide range of applications, and may be preferred for simplicity of use even when it is possible to design superior methods for particular problems. We also make available open source software4 which implements all our suggestions.},

  Abstract                 = {This chapter reviews recent advances in nonparametric and semiparametric estimation, with an emphasis on applicability to empirical research and on resolving issues that arise in implementation. It considers techniques for estimating densities, conditional mean functions, derivatives of functions and conditional quantiles in a flexible way that imposes minimal functional form assumptions. The chapter begins by illustrating how flexible modeling methods have been applied in empirical research, drawing on recent examples of applications from labor economics, consumer demand estimation and treatment effects models. Then, key concepts in semiparametric and nonparametric modeling are introduced that do not have counterparts in parametric modeling, such as the so-called curse of dimensionality, the notion of models with an infinite number of parameters, the criteria used to define optimal convergence rates, and #dimension-free# estimators. After defining these new concepts, a large literature on nonparametric estimation is reviewed and a unifying framework presented for thinking about how different approaches relate to one another. Local polynomial estimators are discussed in detail and their distribution theory is developed. The chapter then shows how nonparametric estimators form the building blocks for many semiparametric estimators, such as estimators for average derivatives, index models, partially linear models, and additively separable models. Semiparametric methods offer a middle ground between fully nonparametric and parametric approaches. Their main advantage is that they typically achieve faster rates of convergence than fully nonparametric approaches. In many cases, they converge at the parametric rate. The second part of the chapter considers in detail two issues that are central with regard to implementing flexible modeling methods: how to select the values of smoothing parameters in an optimal way and how to implement #trimming# procedures. It also reviews newly developed techniques for deriving the distribution theory of semiparametric estimators. The chapter concludes with an overview of approximation methods that speed up the computation of nonparametric estimates and make flexible estimation feasible even in very large size samples.},

  Abstract                 = {Political scientists have long been concerned about the validity of survey measurements. Indeed, given the increasing use of survey experiments, measurement error represents a threat to causal inference. Although many have studied classical measurement error in linear regression models where the error is assumed to arise completely at random, in a number of situations the error may be correlated with the outcome. Such differential measurement error often arises in retrospective studies where the treatment is measured after the outcome is realized. We analyze the impact of differential measurement error on causal estimation by deriving the sharp bounds of the average treatment effect. The proposed nonparametric identification analysis avoids arbitrary modeling decisions and formally characterizes the roles of additional assumptions. We show the serious consequences of differential misclassification and offer a new sensitivity analysis that allows researchers to evaluate the robustness of their conclusions. Our methods are motivated by a field experiment on democratic deliberations, in which one set of estimates potentially suffers from differential misclassification. We show that an analysis ignoring differential measurement error may considerably overestimate the causal effects. The finding contrasts with the case of classical measurement error which always yields attenuation bias.},

  Abstract                 = {The mechanism of financial transactions provided to society today cannot be determined by a single financial institution, but is determined through a complex structure of mutual cooperation, or a "network", between several financial institutions. Quantitative analysis of such a "network" structure had not been explored until recently, mainly due to limitations in the data available. This paper analyzes the "network" structure of financial transactions, using the logged data of financial transactions through the BOJ-Net (Current Account of the Bank of Japan), which became obtainable after the introduction of RTGS (Real Time Gross Settlement) in 2001. This study uses recently developed methods of statistical physics. This field of study provides an analytical framework that treats the complex structure of financial institutions as a structure of elements, or "nodes," that are connected to one another, through "links." Our study shows that the "network" of financial transactions between financial institutions possess fractal structure, similar to that observed in network structures in the natural world (such as river basins) or the structure of the Internet. We also find that financial institutions situated in the middle of the network structure hold more links than those institutions on the periphery of the network, implying that the formed structure is a result of the pursuance of "efficiency" rather than "stability." We should pay enough attention to the dynamic nature of the network structure in order to evaluate its stability, since the network structure of financial transactions is not static in nature(the network is not based upon hardware like cables, as in the case of the Internet). Thus, there is a need to confirm the stability of the network structure over time. In this respect, further analysis of "dynamic networks" is worth a try, based on the evidence shown in this paper which confirms a certain degree of robustness within the network. },

  Abstract                 = {An influential line of argument holds that globalization causes economic uncertainty and spurs popular demands for compensatory welfare state spending. This article argues that the relationship between globalization and welfare state expansion is spurious and that the engine of welfare state expansion since the 1960s has been deindustrialization. Based on cross-sectional-time-series data for fifteen OECD countries, the authors show that there is no relationship between globalization and the level of labor-market risks (in terms of employment and wages), whereas the uncertainty and dislocations caused by deindustrialization have spurred electoral demands for welfare state compensation and risk sharing. Yet, while differential rates of deindustrialization explain differences in the overall size of the welfare state, its particular character--in terms of the share of direct government provision and the equality of transfer payments--is shaped by government partisanship. The argument has implications for the study and the future of the welfare state that are very different from those suggested in the globalization literature.},

We develop a general model of redistribution that explains why some democratic governments are more prone to redistribute than others. We show that the electoral system plays a key role because it shapes the nature of political parties and the composition of governing coalitions, hence redistribution. Our argument implies (1) that center-left governments dominate under PR systems, whereas center-right governments dominate under majoritarian systems; and (2) that PR systems redistribute more than majoritarian systems. We test our argument on panel data for redistribution, government partisanship, and electoral system in advanced democracies. },

The results suggest that countries whose ideal points are closer to the United Sates are more likely to get elected than all other UN Members, including the median voter. Despite the pres- ence of relatively democratic procedures on electing non-permanent members, UN Members tend to elect pro-U.S. countries voluntarily so that the Council functions efficiently without being disturbed by countries with conflicting interests. I also find that countries which have a reputation for free-riding or transgressing are less likely to obtain seats on the Council. This result suggests that UN Members attempt to prevent the suboptimal provision of the public good by punishing members which fail to bear the burden or break important international norms.

  Abstract                 = {Bayesian statistics have made great strides in recent years, developing a class of methods for estimation and inference via stochastic simulation known as Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods. MCMC constitutes a revolution in statistical practice with effects beginning to be felt in the social sciences: models long consigned to the "too hard" basket are now within reach of quantitative researchers. I review the statistical pedigree of MCMC and the underlying statistical concepts. I demonstrate some of the strengths and weaknesses of MCMC and offer practical suggestions for using MCMC in social-science settings. Simple, illustrative examples include a probit model of voter turnout and a linear regression for time-series data with autoregressive disturbances. I conclude with a more challenging application, a multinomial probit model, to showcase the power of MCMC methods.},

  Abstract                 = { Dyad-year data on international conflict are simultaneously qualitative and serially dependent. Extending Beck, Katz, and Tuckerâs (1998) methodological contribution, I propose transitional models that deal with these two features of the data. These statistical models explicitly deal with the way a dyadâs particular history of peace or conflict structures current outcomes, consistent with important substantive notions in the IR literature such as reputation-building, signalling, alliance reliability, territoriality, and enduring rivalries. That is, I propose statistical models that (a) are easily estimated; (b) resolve long-standing methodological dilemmas, and (c) speak to important theoretical ideas in the study of international relations. The transitional models I propose generalize beyond the international conflict data analyzed here, to any type of discrete time-series setting. One of the transitional models I propose is a novel methodological contribution in its own right --- a dynamic probit model --- unifying two hitherto disparate branches of quantitative political methodology (time series and discrete choice) },

  Abstract                 = {Measurement is critical to the social scientific enterprise. Many key concepts in social- scientific theories are not observed directly, and researchers rely on assumptions (tacitly or explicitly, via formal measurement models) to operationalize these concepts in empirical work. Factor analysis is one such approach, probably the workhorse measurement techniques in the social sciences. However, we show that item-response models are of tremendous utility in social-scientific settings, well-suited to use away from of their ÃâhomeÃâ in educational testing. Recent statistical and computational advances (i.e., Markov chain Monte Carlo techniques) mean that the strength, flexibility and full potential of item-response models can now be fully realized. Unlike traditional factor analysis, item-response models solve the indeterminacy of micro-level Ãâfactor scoresÃâ (each observational unitÃâs score on the latent dimensions) and are easily extensible to handle binary or ordinal indicator variables and missing data. We demonstrate the utility of item-response models by analyzing a question- formatting experiment in the 2000 National Election Studies; we find that issue-specific self- placement items asked with a successive ÃâbranchingÃâ format (versus the traditional 7 point scale format) provide higher discrimination with respect to the latent ideological dimensions.},

  Abstract                 = {This paper offers a new approach to the study of economic problems usually modeled as games of incomplete information with discontinuous payoffs. Typically, the discontinuities arise from indeterminacies (ties) in the underlying problem. The point of view taken here is that the tie-breaking rules that resolve these indeterminacies should be viewed as part of the solution rather than part of the description of the model. A solution is therefore a tie-breaking rule together with strategies satisfying the usual best-response criterion. When information is incomplete, solutions need not exist; that is, there may be no tie-breaking rule that is compatible with the existence of strategy profiles satisfying the usual bestresponse criteria. It is shown that the introduction of incentive compatible communication (cheap talk) restores existence.},

Inference for multiple change-points requires methods that can handle large data sets and can be implemented efficiently for estimating the number of change-points as well as their locations. Our review in this important area focuses on some of the recent advances in this direction. Greater emphasis is placed on multivariate data while reviewing inferential methods for a single change-point in time series. Throughout the article, more attention is paid to estimation of unknown change-point(s) in time series, and this is especially true in the case of multiple change-points. Some specific data sets for which change-point modelling has been carried out in the literature are provided as illustrative examples under both single and multiple change-point scenarios.},

This paper uses the surprise event to demonstrate what I term the “Jeffords effect”: changes in the political landscape have large effects on the market value of firms. I use a firm’s soft‐money donations to the national parties as the measure of how the firm aligns itself politically. In this event study, a firm lost .8 percent of market capitalization the week of Jeffords’s switch for every \$250,000 it gave to the Republicans in the previous election cycle. On the basis of the point estimates, the stock price gain associated with Democratic donations is smaller than the loss associated with Republican donations, but the estimates are consistent with the effects being equal and opposite. The results withstand several robustness checks, and the effects appear to persist over time.},

  Abstract                 = {Political scientists have examined how the competition for capital affects the setting of national tax rates. Yet taxes levied on firms are often subject to special exemptions that are negotiated between government actors and the firm. In this paper I explore how political institutions, specifically the level of democracy, affect firm-level tax setting across the world. While democratic institutions can affect tax setting through a number of mechanisms, the overall relationship is an empirical question. Using a confidential data set on firm tax payments on the foreign affiliates of U.S. Multinational Corporations from the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis I show that there are large variations within countries on the tax burdens faced by firms. I find evidence that the mobility of the specific investment project, the types of spillovers these investments provide to a community, and attributes of the parent firm are all important determinants of taxation. While firm level factors clearly affect corporate taxation, I argue that democratic institutions constrain the ability of governments to offer special tax deals to multinational corporations. After controlling for parent firm and foreign levels factors I find that democratic institutions greatly reduce the likelihood of firms receiving tax exemptions. This leads to firms paying on average 20\% more corporate taxes in democratic regimes.},

  Abstract                 = {An extensive literature in international and comparative political economy has focused on the how the mobility of capital affects the ability of governments to tax and regulate firms. The conventional wisdom holds that governments are in competition with each other to attract foreign direct investment (FDI). Nation-states observe the fiscal and regulatory decisions of competitor governments, and are forced to either respond with policy changes or risk losing foreign direct investment, along with the politically salient jobs that come with these investments. The political economy of FDI suggests a network of investments with complicated dependencies. We propose an empirical strategy for modeling investment patterns in 24 advanced industrialized countries from 1985-2000. Using bilateral FDI data we estimate how increases in flows of FDI affect the flows of FDI in other countries. Our statistical model is based on the methodology developed by Westveld & Hoff (2007). The model allows the temporal examination of each notion's activity level in investing, attractiveness to investors, and reciprocity between pairs of nations. We extend the model by treating the reported inflow and outflow data as independent replicates of the true value and allowing for a mixture model for the fixed effects portion of the network model. Using a fully Bayesian approach, we also impute missing data within the MCMC algorithm used to fit the model.},

  Abstract                 = {This study of perception and misperception in foreign policy was a landmark in the application of cognitive psychology to political decision making. The \_New York Times\_ called it, in an article published nearly ten years after the book's appearance, "the seminal statement of principles underlying political psychology." The perspective established by Jervis remains an important counterpoint to structural explanations of international politics, and from it has developed a large literature on the psychology of leaders and the problems of decision making under conditions of incomplete information, stress, and cognitive bias. Jervis begins by describing the process of perception (for example, how decision makers learn from history) and then explores common forms of misperception (such as overestimating one's influence). Finally, he tests his ideas through a number of important events in international relations from nineteenth- and twentieth-century European history. In a contemporary application of Jervis's ideas, some argue that Saddam Hussein invaded Kuwait in 1990 in part because he misread the signals of American leaders with regard to the independence of Kuwait. Also, leaders of the United States and Iraq in the run-up to the most recent Gulf War might have been operating under cognitive biases that made them value certain kinds of information more than others, whether or not the information was true. Jervis proved that, once a leader believed something, that perception would influence the way the leader perceived all other relevant information.},

In this paper, we extend the median concept to the domain of graphs. In terms of graph distance, we introduce the novel concepts of set median and generalized median of a set of graphs. We study properties of both types of median graphs. For the more complex task of computing generalized median graphs, a genetic search algorithm is developed. Experiments conducted on randomly generated graphs demonstrate the advantage of generalized median graphs compared to set median graphs and the ability of our genetic algorithm to find approximate generalized median graphs in reasonable time. Application examples with both synthetic and nonsynthetic data are shown to illustrate the practical usefulness of the concept of median graphs.},

However, Congress typically decides whether to delegate not to an individual but to an institution, which consists of many individuals with diÃÂ¤ering preferences. To improve on existing models, I design models of delegation without assuming that bureaucracies are unitary actors. Results show that the ally principle does not hold when bureaucratic structure is incor- porated.

  Abstract                 = {This paper proposes an estimation method for a repeated auction game under the presence of capacity constraints. The estimation strategy is computationally simple as it does not require solving for the equilibrium of the game. It uses a two stage approach. In the first stage the distribution of bids conditional on state variables is estimated using data on bids, bidder characteristics, and contract characteristics. In the second stage, an expression of the expected sum of future profits based on the distribution of bids is obtained, and costs are inferred based on the first order condition of optimal bids. We apply the estimation method to repeated highway construction procurement auctions in the state of California between May 1996 and May 1999. In this market, previously won uncompleted contracts reduce the probability of winning further contracts. We quantify the effect of intertemporal constraints on bidders' costs and on bids. Due to the intertemporal effect and also to bidder asymmetry, the auction can be inefficient. Based on the estimates of costs, we quantify efficiency losses.},

  Abstract                 = {Abstract We fit deterministic generalized Lanchester models to daily sortie and loss data from the Battle of Britain. The best fit for the period 14th August to 30th October 1940 is Î´B â¼ G1.2, Î´G â¼ G0.9, where B and G are RAF Fighter Command and Luftwaffe sortie numbers, and Î´B and Î´G are daily loss numbers, respectively. The data naturally divide into two phases, with losses (as a proportion of overall sortie numbers) much reduced after 15th September. Fits were generally better for the first phase than for the second, and for British losses than for German; in every case the dependence on G is stronger than that on B. Days with higher sortie numbers on average favored the Luftwaffe, whereas the loss-ratio was not significantly dependent on the force ratio. Â© 2008 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

  Abstract                 = {Why respect culture? The demand for respect that I have in mind is not satisfied when we simply recognize or acknowledge cultural differences. It instead requires that we accord the particularistic claims of cultural communities special normative weight in our political judgments and deliberation. And it requires that we pursue policies and design institutions that actively protect and promote particularistic cultural commitments. Many political philosophers urge us to respect. culture in just this sense. I argue that while they presume that we should do so, they do not offer compelling reasons why. What is more, on a quite plausible account of :how culture works, these political philosophers probably cannot provide persuasive reasons. Simply put, we do not have moral reasons to respect culture in any direct sense.},

  Abstract                 = {Even before 9/11 there were claims that the nature of war had changed fundamentally. The 9/11 attacks created an urgent need to understand contemporary wars and their relationship to older conventional and terrorist wars, both of which exhibit remarkable regularities. The frequency-intensity distribution of fatalities in "old wars", 1816-1980, is a power-law with exponent 1.80. Global terrorist attacks, 1968-present, also follow a power-law with exponent 1.71 for G7 countries and 2.5 for non-G7 countries. Here we analyze two ongoing, high-profile wars on opposite sides of the globe - Colombia and Iraq. Our analysis uses our own unique dataset for killings and injuries in Colombia, plus publicly available data for civilians killed in Iraq. We show strong evidence for power-law behavior within each war. Despite substantial differences in contexts and data coverage, the power-law coefficients for both wars are tending toward 2.5, which is a value characteristic of non-G7 terrorism as opposed to old wars. We propose a plausible yet analytically-solvable model of modern insurgent warfare, which can explain these observations.},

The first provides mathematical notation and formulas for use in later chapters of this book and in the companion Wiley volumes on continuous and multivariate distributions. The second section introduces statistical definitions that are required later. It also gives key references to the statistical literature, enabling readers to boost their statistical knowledge where needed. The computer generation of pseudo-random variables has mostly been moved to more appropriate places in the book. Contact details for the more important statistical packages are given.},

But a stipulation that Ã¢â¬Åjudges should care about reasonsÃ¢â¬ï¿½ is not by itself sufficient to justify the current regime of rationality review. If one thinks that the bases for agency action ought to be policed by the courts, one has to ask whether the rules courts (are supposed to) follow in reviewing the basis for agency decisions in fact cause administrators to choose among policies on the desired grounds, when they would otherwise resort to some unsavory considerations. The most troubling worry about the effectiveness of rationality review stems from the nature of reasons themselves. Judges cannot directly observe administratorsÃ¢â¬â¢ actual reasons for their decisions. This paper attempts first to render these concerns precise, and second to explore the implications of these concerns for the design of judicial rules.},

The underlying model is autoregressive and non-Gaussian, allowing for both skewness and fat tails, and the units are clustered according to their dynamic behavior, equilibrium level, and the effect of covariates. Inference is addressed from a Bayesian perspective, and model comparison is conducted using Bayes factors. Particular attention is paid to prior elicitation and posterior propriety. We suggest priors that require little subjective input and have hierarchical structures that enhance inference robustness. We apply our methodology to GDP growth of European regions and to employment growth of Spanish firms. },

  Abstract                 = {The intersection of law and politics provides tentative answers for two questions: First, why, among the variety of institutional forms available to governments, are legalized institutions preferred in some contexts and not in others? Second. what are the consequences of legalization? Explanations for variation in legalization are directed to the supply of legalized institutions, grounded in the preferences of the most powerful states. Those preferences are shaped, in turn, by domestic political demands for legalization as well as unanticipated domestic political dynamics that can increase legalization over time. Domestic political demands for legalization have increased as a result of international economic integration; the effects of democratization have been more ambiguous. Outside the industrialized democracies, the intersection of supply and demand is often different: supply of legalized institutions is lower and sovereignty costs are often higher. The authors in this special issue examine three important consequences of legalization: its effects on government compliance with international agreements, its impact on the evolution of international norms, and the conditions under which it will harden and spread. In each case, domestic political links are central to the effects of legalization. International agreements and institutions that are legalized, compared with those that an not, seem to be more deeply rooted in domestic politics: their existence often draws on both anticipated and unanticipated actions by domestic actors; their consequences are shaped by domestic characteristics and constituencies.},

  Abstract                 = {Like security prices, retail deposit interest rates cluster around integers and "even" fractions. However, explanations for security price clustering are incompatible with deposit rate clustering. A theory based on the limited recall of retail depositors is proposed. It predicts that banks tend to set rates at integers and that rates are "sticky" at these levels. The propensity for integer rates increases with the level of wholesale interest rates and deposit market concentration. When banks set noninteger rates, rates are more likely to be just above, rather than just below, integers. The paper finds substantial empirical support for the theory's implications.},

  Abstract                 = {Objective The Karolinska sleepiness scale (KSS) is frequently used for evaluating subjective sleepiness. The main aim of the present study was to investigate the validity and reliability of the KSS with electroencephalographic, behavioral and other subjective indicators of sleepiness.Methods Participants were 16 healthy females aged 33-43 (38.1Â±2.68) years. The experiment involved 8 measurement sessions per day for 3 consecutive days. Each session contained the psychomotor vigilance task (PVT), the Karolinska drowsiness test (KDT--EEG alpha & theta power), the alpha attenuation test (AAT--alpha power ratio open/closed eyes) and the KSS.Results Median reaction time, number of lapses, alpha and theta power density and the alpha attenuation coefficients (AAC) showed highly significant increase with increasing KSS. The same variables were also significantly correlated with KSS, with a mean value for lapses (r=0.56).Conclusions The KSS was closely related to EEG and behavioral variables, indicating a high validity in measuring sleepiness.Significance KSS ratings may be a useful proxy for EEG or behavioral indicators of sleepiness.},

He shows how war became a natural function of politics, a logical consequence of contemporary political behavior. Rather than fighting simply to expand, states in each war fought for specific political and economic reasons. The book illustrates the extraordinary power of politics and war in modern Western civilization, if not in history as a whole. In a provocative and original new preface and chapter, Kaiser shows which aspects of four past areas of conflict do, and do not, seem relevant to the immediate future, and he sketches out some new possibilities for Europe.},

  Abstract                 = {We estimate the parameters of a stochastic game of two-party competition (Kalandrakis 2006) using the actual sequence of electoral winners in four countries with two-party parliamentary systems. We finnd that moderate parties that lose elections are almost twice as likely to remain moderate, than the corresponding probability for extreme parties to remain extreme. About 20\%-25\% of electoral outcomes are determined by random events not pertaining to the competition of the two parties on the left-right dimension. The attainment of government office by the party is valued considerably even by the party's policy extremists, who evaluate the utility from office up to twice as much as the utility gain from a policy shift from their worst preferred policy to their most preferred one. The UK and Greece experienced more polarized equilibrium dynamics than Australia (and New Zealand). There is evidence that there are no significant country specific diverences in the estimated model structural parameters. We find strong evidence of a structural break in party reputations prior to the 1983 UK election leading to the end of "consensus" politics, and evidence of structural break prior to the 1990 Greek elections.},

  Abstract                 = {The clustering coefficient has been used successfully to summarise important features of unweighted, undirected networks across a wide range of applications. Recently, a number of authors have extended this concept to the case of networks with non-negatively weighted edges. After reviewing various alternatives, we focus on a definition due to Zhang and Horvath that can be traced back to earlier work of Grindrod. We give a natural and transparent derivation of this clustering coefficient and then analyse its properties. One attraction of this version is that it deals directly with weighted edges and avoids the need to discretise, that is, to round weights up to 1 or down to 0. This has the advantages of (a) retaining all edge weight information, and (b) eliminating the requirement for an arbitrary cutoff level. Further, the extended definition is much less likely to break down due to a `divide-by-zero'. Using our new derivation and focussing on some special cases allows us to gain insights into the typical behaviour of this measure. We then illustrate the idea by computing the generalised clustering coefficients, along with the corresponding weighted degrees, for pairwise correlation gene expression data arising from microarray experiments. We find that the weighted clustering and degree distributions reveal global topological differences between normal and tumour networks.},

  Abstract                 = { Because they are chiefly domestic conflicts, civil wars have been studied primarily from a perspective stressing domestic factors. We ask, instead, whether (and how) the international system shapes civil wars; we find that it does shape the way in which they are foughtâtheir âtechnology of rebellion.â After disaggregating civil wars into irregular wars (or insurgencies), conventional wars, and symmetric nonconventional wars, we report a striking decline of irregular wars following the end of the Cold War, a remarkable transformation of internal conflict. Our analysis brings the international system back into the study of internal conflict. It specifies the connection between system polarity and the Cold War on the one hand and domestic warfare on the other hand. It also demonstrates that irregular war is not the paradigmatic mode of civil war as widely believed, but rather is closely associated with the structural characteristics of the Cold War. },

  Abstract                 = {The authors analyze a unique data source to study the determinants of violence against civilians in a civil war context. During the Vietnam War, the United States Department of Defense pioneered the use of quantitative analysis for operational purposes. The centerpiece of that effort was the Hamlet Evaluation System (HES), a monthly and quarterly rating of `the status of pacification at the hamlet and village level throughout the Republic of Vietnam'. Consistent with existing theoretical claims, the authors find that homicidal violence against civilians was a function of the level of territorial control exercised by the rival sides: Vietnamese insurgents relied on selective violence primarily where they enjoyed predominant, but not full, control; South Vietnamese government and US forces exercised indiscriminate violence primarily in the most rebel-dominated areas. Violence was less common in the most contested areas. The absence of spatial overlap between insurgent selective and incumbent indiscriminate violence, as well as the relative absence of violence from contested areas, demonstrates both the fundamental divergence between irregular and conventional war and the need for cautious use of violent events as indicators of conflict.},

I use a regression discontinuity design to study the impact of the CalGrant program in California on college going. Eligibility requires students to meet minimum thresholds on three characteristics: income, assets and high school Grade Point Average. Because there are several dimensions of eligibility, the analysis allows for specification tests, estimating any discontinuities along a given dimension of eligibility, dependent upon whether one satisfied the other two dimensions of eligibility. The paper uses a novel data collection strategy to measure subsequent college enrollment for 150,000 financial aid applicants in 1998 and 1999. The results suggest large impacts (3 to 4 percentage points) of grant eligibility on college enrollment among financial aid applicants, with larger impacts on the choice of private four-year colleges in California.},

Unlike their differences in constituency size, the pro-trade leanings of the Presidency and Senate are postwar phenomena. Even now state size is unrelated to Senators' votes on trade. In tests pooling legislators from both Houses, chamber membership predicts votes while constituency size generally does not. Senators are even less protectionist than Representatives with identical constituencies.},

They claim that presidents favor freer trade and will use the negotiating authority Congress delegates to them to reach agreements lowering trade barriers. Since presidents gain more support from their congressional co-partisans, less liberalization ensues under divided government. This theory rests on the premise that party is unrelated to congressional trade policy preferences beyond legislators' tendencies to support their presidential co-partisans. Yet before 1970 congressional Democrats were relatively free trading regardless of the president's party affiliation. Since then, the same has been true of Republicans. Divided government facilitates the trade policies of presidents from the protectionist party since they win more support from their "opposition" in this area. Divided government does impede the efforts of presidents from the free-trading party to liberalize. I conclude that divided government has no consistent effect on trade policy outcomes.},

  Abstract                 = {A game theoretic model of scrip systems in analyzed. It is shown that scrip sys- tems have pure strategy equilibria in a natural class of strategies. An algorithm is given that can compute such an equilibrium and the resulting distribution of money (scrip). The effect of varying the total amount of money in the system on efficiency (i.e., social welfareâthe total utility of all the agents in the system) is analyzed, and it is shown that by maintaining the appropriate ratio between the total amount of money and the number of agents, efficiency is maximized. This ratio can be found by increasing the money supply up to the point that the system experiences a âmonetary crash,â where money is sufficiently devalued that no agent is willing to perform a service. The implications of the presence of altruists, hoarders, sybils, and collusion on the performance of the system are examined. In practice, agents in a scrip system will not have the necessary in- formation to compute this equilibrium. However, a simple learning algorithm is investigated and simulation results are presented that show it enables agents to converge to equilibrium.},

  Abstract                 = { When political scientists present empirical results, they are much more likely to use tables than graphs, despite the fact that graphs greatly increases the clarity of presentation and makes it easier for a reader to understand the data being used and to draw clear and correct inferences. Using a sample of leading journals, we document this tendency and suggest reasons why researchers prefer tables. We argue that the extra work required in producing graphs is rewarded by greatly enhanced presentation and communication of empirical results. We illustrate their benefits by turning several published tables into graphs, including tables that present descriptive data and regression results. We show that regression graphs emphasize point estimates and confidence intervals and that they can successfully present the results of regression models. A move away from tables towards graphs would improve the discipline&apos;s communicative output and make empirical findings more accessible to every type of audience.Jonathan P.

But rapidly growing economic ties between Mainland China and Taiwan show that commerce can also flourish even in the presence of very hostile relations. I explore this variation and hypothesize that the effects of international political conflict on trade are less severe in cases where internationalist economic interests have relatively strong political clout domestically. Simple quantitative tests on a sample of seventy-six countries over the years 1961 to 1992 are supportive; further evidence is provided via a brief case study of Mainland China-Taiwan relations.},

  Abstract                 = {This paper presents a new theory about the effect of foreign aid on growth and tests this theory using new data on 195 countries for the years between 1950-2004. The model includes two types of coup-plotters who differ with regard to their ability to achieve economic growth. Foreign donors give aid to successful coup-makers only if the coup took place in a geostrategically important country. Aid to important countries attracts the bad type of coup-makers to the political arena and results in coups with economically bad consequences. I hypothesize that the end of the Cold War changed aggregate coup numbers and their economic effects by rendering many countries unimportant. As a result it is not profitable anymore for the bad types to stage coups in these countries. Among the coups we observe in the post-Cold War period a bigger proportion is made by the good type of coup-makers and this leads to a better average economic effect of coups. The implication is that the drop in coup numbers and their less negative impact can be reversed as countries regain their importance due to the War on Terror or China's desire for raw materials.},

An error correction model with spatial weighting reveals a strong relationship between foreign and domestic partisan vote intent over over both the short- and long-run. Moreover, short-run eÃ¯Â¬â¬ects have in- creased both over time and with trade openness, suggesting a role for international economic integration. The data conÃ¯Â¬ï¿½rm this: Both the domestic and international components of at least one economic aggregate Ã¢â¬â unemployment Ã¢â¬â prove a strong pre- dictor of shifts in domestic vote intent.

Spatial force movement and troop interaction components are represented with both local and non-local terms, expanding upon the swarming behaviour of fish and birds proposed by Mogilner et al.

  Abstract                 = {The notion of state resolve forms a central part of most theories of war initiation in international relations, yet has remained relatively unexplored empirically. I propose a definition of state resolve as a latent utility to be estimated from the data and derive a structural estimator with which to estimate it. The structural estimation technique has three principle benefits: the computed quantity is consistent with theory; modeling resolve as a latent variable allows the researcher to easily quantify the uncertainty in the measure; finally, it is straightforward to estimate the causes of resolve. Since the costs of war are revealed during wartime, and these costs are crucial in determining whether or not to go to war in the first place, I apply a Bayesian iterative procedure to measure revealed resolve of the participants in a conflict at time t, and also prior expectations about resolve at time t+1. Our results indicate that resolve is a function of institutional parameters that indicate (1) regime type, (2) state repression, (3) the fates of rulers, and (4) material inequality prior to war.},

  Abstract                 = {Two defining features of the conduct of warfare are (1) the fact that it is limited in means, duration, and outcome and (2) the fact that it is an extractive process that transfers resources from subjects to state control. I derive and analyze a dynamic game which models the interaction between these related facts by requiring the ruler to extract the means of war from his subjects and formulate his war aims endogenously. I then characterize the effect of military victory and defeat on the willingness of the subjects to bear the costs of war. The relationship between the marginal effect of one more military victory on the balance between the expected future course of the war and coercive diplomacy emerges as the central factor influencing both subject resolve and war aims. Societal parameters dictate subject resolve in war, and as a result, authoritarian states with large material inequality and weak state structures will be less resolved and ambitious in war. Wars end with the achievement of limited aims because the underlying societal arrangements are unable to generate state resolve sufficient to achieve total victory, the result of a commitment problem in the post-war world. This implies that as an outside option in a larger coercive process, total war is only available to some actors, some of the time.},

Although the formation of the state is closely related to the need to provide a means to implement policy, the dynamics underlying the creation of governance mechanisms are not well understood. To answer these questions, I analyze a formal model in which a sovereign must delegate policy implementation to local barons, aware that doing so empowers those barons to act against him. I find that (1) weak sovereigns construct federations by relying on barons whose policy preferences mirror their own while strong sovereigns construct centralized states by relying on barons whose policy preferences are far from their own; (2) as the status quo moves further from the policy preference of the sovereign, he provides more governance within the realm; (3) if the distribution of power in the realm is homogeneous then the sovereign will create a state in which policy implementation favors only one side of the ideological spectrum. These results suggest that the formation of delineated territorial borders is derived from the relationship between the status quo and the policy preferences and strength of the neighboring rulers.},

Following Anderson and Neary (1992, 1994) and Feenstra (1995), they use these estimates to construct theoretically sound trade restrictiveness indices and GDP losses associated with existing tariff structures. Countries are revealed to be 30 percent more restrictive than their simple or import-weighted average tariffs would suggest. Thus, distortion is nontrivial. GDP losses are largest in China, Germany, India, Mexico, and the United States.},

An examination of the institutional nature of the relationship between the president and the Fed casts doubt on this assertion. We argue that the president's use of this institutional prerogative, as a means of influencing Fed policy activity, is a more limited tool than previously realized.},

  Abstract                 = {Governments unable to make credible promises hinder economic development and effective policymaking. Scholars have focused considerable attention on checks and balances and the delegation of authority to independent agencies as institutional solutions to this problem. The political conditions under which these institutions enhance credibility, rather than policy stability, are still unclear, however. We show that checks-multiple veto players-enhance credibility, depending on the extent of uncertainty about the location of the status quo, on how agenda control is allocated among the veto players, and on whether veto players have delegated policymaking authority to independent agencies. In the context of monetary policy and independent central banks, we find evidence supporting the following predictions: Delegation is more likely to enhance credibility and political replacements of central bank governors are less likely in the presence of multiple political veto players; this effect increases with the polarization of veto players.},

While statistical analyses can help establish causal relationships, it can also provide strong evidence of causality where none exists. In this essay, I provide an overview of the statistics of causal inference. Instead of focusing on specific statistical methods, such as matching, I focus more on the assumptions needed to give statistical estimates a causal interpretation. Such assumptions are often referred to as identification assumptions, and these assumptions are critical to any statistical analysis about causal effects. I outline a wide range of identification assumptions and highlight the design-based approach to causal inference. I conclude with an overview of statistical methods that are frequently used for causal inference.},

After the creation of the International Criminal Court, the United States tried to get countries, regardless of whether they were parties to the Court or not, to sign agreements not to surrender Americans to the Court. Why did some states sign and others not? Given United States power and threats of military sanctions, some states did sign. However, such factors tell only part of the story. When refusing to sign, many states emphasized the moral value of the court. Further, states with a high domestic rule of law emphasized the importance of keeping their commitment. This article therefore advances two classic arguments that typically are difficult to substantiate; namely, state preferences are indeed partly normative, and international commitments do not just screen states; they also constrain.},

It appears that there is indeed a difference between expert and document driven scaling. Thirdly, I examine external validity by comparing different scales in relation to various political variables. The analysis shows that the scales, when used as variables in comparative political research, produce different effects. The conclusion is that - in addition to internal validity problems - the external validity of scaled variables generated from different types of data needs to be assessed more carefully than is often the case in comparative politics.},

  Abstract                 = {In many international relations datasets, there are observations for which the depen- dent variable is difficult or impossible to code. For example, when the outcome of interest is conflict initiation, it is not straightforward to classify the behavior of an attacked state. If Germany in- vades France in a particular year, Franceâs decision of whether to attack Germany is censored; we cannot observe whether it would have done so. I argue that such situations constitute missing data problems where the assumption of missingness at random does not hold. Following the partial identification and nonparametric bounding literature, I develop a method for estimating bounds on logistic regression coefficients when covariates are available for all observations but some outcomes are missing. This entails characterizing the full set of coefficients that could be obtained under some assumption about the missing outcomes. The estimator is the set of minimizers of a criterion func- tion defined by moment inequalities. Using simulated data, I find that this approach recovers the âidentified setâ of possible parameter estimates, whereas alternative methods have poor coverage. I also apply the method to examine the robustness of prior results in the political science litera- ture. The first application is to data on the outbreak of militarized international disputes, where the dependent variable is treated as unclassifiable if the dispute is continued from a previous year. The second application is a replication of Lyallâs (2010) analysis of democraciesâ counterinsurgency behavior, where the outcome of interest is victory against an insurgency, but some hard-to-classify observations are coded as âdraws.â },

  Abstract                 = {I consider a model of electoral competition in which candidates spend money to win voter support. As a candidate spends more on advertisements touting his or her positive traits, voters increase their assessments of that candidateâs quality. Voters care both about both perceived candidate quality and the policy that the candidate will adopt if elected, but only spending is directly observable. However, the costliness of effort required to raise funds is related to a candidateâs policy intentions, so spending choices serve as signals of policy commitments. I focus on the case when more extreme candidatesâthose whose policy intentions are farther from the median voterâs ideal pointâfind it easier to raise money. I characterize an equilibrium of this model and show that it is almost always unique among those that satisfy the D1 refinement. In equilibrium, well-funded extremists are never electorally disadvantaged relative to poorly-funded centrists, because they can feign centrism (by spending little) if doing so is favorable. I show that, in the context of this model, campaign finance regulations targeted at extremists can bring expected policy outcomes closer to the median voterâs ideal point. However, in all such cases, reform reduces the median voterâs ex ante expected utility.},

  Abstract                 = {This book is a comprehensive study of cooperation among the advanced capitalist countries. Can cooperation persist without the dominance of a single power, such as the United States after World War II? To answer this pressing question, Robert Keohane analyzes the institutions, or "international regimes," through which cooperation has taken place in the world political economy and describes the evolution of these regimes as American hegemony has eroded. Refuting the idea that the decline of hegemony makes cooperation impossible, he views international regimes not as weak substitutes for world government but as devices for facilitating decentralized cooperation among egoistic actors. In the preface the author addresses the issue of cooperation after the end of the Soviet empire and with the renewed dominance of the United States, in security matters, as well as recent scholarship on cooperation.},

  Abstract                 = {We identify two ideal types of international third-party dispute resolution: interstate and transnational. Under interstate dispute resolution, states closely control selection of, access to, and compliance with international courts and tribunals. Under transnational dispute resolution, by contrast, individuals and nongovernmental entities have significant influence over selection, access, and implementation. This distinction helps to explain the politics of international legalization-in particular, the initiation of cases, the tendency of courts to challenge national governments, the extent of compliance with judgments, and the long-term evolution of norms within legalized international regimes. By reducing the transaction costs of setting the process in motion and establishing new constituencies, transnational dispute resolution is more likely than interstate dispute resolution to generate a large number of cases. The types of cases brought under transnational dispute resolution lead more readily to challenges of state actions by international courts. Transnational dispute resolution tends to he associated with greater compliance with international legal judgments, particularly when autonomous domestic institutions such as the judiciary mediate between individuals and the international institutions. Overall, transnational dispute resolution enhances the prospects for long-term deepening and widening of international legalization.},

  Abstract                 = {While many scholars have posited a simultaneous relationship between trade and conflict, very few empirical studies have specified the relationship as such. Those that did employed samples that were relatively limited in spatial-temporal coverage. None have employed conflict indicators based on Militarized Interstate Dispute (MID) data due to the difficulty of including discrete dependent variables in a simultaneous equation framework. We overcome both limitations in this study and offer results with important theoretical implications. In line with the most recent published studies, we design our model to "condition" the estimates on recent histories of dyadic trade and conflict. We apply Maddala's estimator, which is designed for a two-equation system in which one endogenous variable is continuous and the other is dichotomous. While the signs of all control variable coefficients match those reported in mainstream trade-conflict literature, our main result does not. We find what we call the "primacy of politics"; i.e., that conflict indeed inhibits trade while the effect of dyadic interdependence on the likelihood of conflict is statistically insignificant. Extensive sensitivity analyses show the results to be consistent across estimators as well as alternative model specifications and trade data sets. We conclude that liberal claims about interdependence and conflict may be problematic.},

Based on the share of gross domestic product devoted to U.N. peacekeeping, there is evidence that the rich nations are assuming a disproportionate burden of peacekeeping in the post-cold war period. This evidence is stronger for NATO than for the two larger samples. When efforts for peacekeeping not financed through the United Nations are included, the disproportionality is even clearer in the 1990s for NATO and the largest samples (accounting for 97\% of U.N. peacekeeping support). Problems with alternative peacekeeping burden-sharing measures also are considered. In light of current developments, future patterns of burden sharing are anticipated, with the richer NATO allies assuming ever greater financial burdens of peacekeeping.},

  Abstract                 = {We investigate the extent to which possession of the veto allows the president to influence congressional decisions regarding regular annual appropriations legislation. The most important implication of our analysis is that the influence the veto conveys is asymmetrical: it allows the president to restrain Congress when he prefers to appropriate less to an agency than Congress does; it does not provide him an effective means of extracting higher appropriations from Congress when he prefers to spend more than it does. This asymmetry derives from constitutional limitations on the veto, in combination with the presence of a de facto reversionary expenditure level contained in the appropriations process (Fenno, 1966). We find strong support for this proposition in a regression of presidential requests upon congressional appropriations decisions.},

Results suggest that the most important changes in time-series variance occur in 1916 and 1933 at small clusters of boundary locations at which, in general, the variance reduces.

  Abstract                 = { In this article, we consider the problem of detecting multiple changepoints in large datasets. Our focus is on applications where the number of changepoints will increase as we collect more data: for example, in genetics as we analyze larger regions of the genome, or in finance as we observe time series over longer periods. We consider the common approach of detecting changepoints through minimizing a cost function over possible numbers and locations of changepoints. This includes several established procedures for detecting changing points, such as penalized likelihood and minimum description length. We introduce a new method for finding the minimum of such cost functions and hence the optimal number and location of changepoints that has a computational cost, which, under mild conditions, is linear in the number of observations. This compares favorably with existing methods for the same problem whose computational cost can be quadratic or even cubic. In simulation studies, we show that our new method can be orders of magnitude faster than these alternative exact methods. We also compare with the binary segmentation algorithm for identifying changepoints, showing that the exactness of our approach can lead to substantial improvements in the accuracy of the inferred segmentation of the data.

  Abstract                 = {Consumers are often observed to purchase more than one variety of a product on a given shopping trip. The simultaneous demand for varieties is observed not only for packaged goods such as yogurt or soft drinks, but in many other product categories such as movies, music compact disks, and apparel. Multinomial (MN) choice models cannot be applied to data exhibiting the simultaneous choice of more than one variety. The random utility interpretation of either the MN logit or probit model uses a linear utility specification that cannot accommodate interior solutions with more than one variety (alternative) chosen. To analyze data with multiple varieties chosen requires a nonstandard utility specification. Standard demand models in the economics literature exhibit only interior solutions. We propose a demand model based on a translated additive utility structure. The model nests the linear utility structure, while allowing for the possibility of a mixture of corner and interior solutions where more than one but not all varieties are selected. We use a random utility specification in which the unobservable portion of marginal utility follows a log-normal distribution. The distribution of quantity demanded (the basis of the likelihood function) is derived from these log-normal random utility errors. The likelihood function for this class of models with mixtures of corner and interior solutions is a mixed distribution with both a continuous density portion and probability mass points for the corners. The probability mass points must be calculated by integrals of the log-normal errors over rectangular regions. We evaluate these high-dimensional integrals using the GHK approximation. We employ a Bayesian hierarchical model, allowing household-specific utility parameters. Our utility specification related to the approach of Wales and Woodland (1983) who employ a translated quadratic utility function. Wales and Woodland were only able to study, at the most, three varieties because there was no practical way to evaluate the utility function at that time. In addition, the quadratic utility specification is not a globally valid utility function, making welfare computations and policy experiments questionable. Hendel (1999) and Dube (1999) present an alternative approach in the utility function which is constructed by summing up over unobservable consumption occasions. While only one variety is consumed on each occasion, the marginal utilities of varieties change over the consumption occasions, giving rise to a simultaneous purchase of multiple varieties. Our Bayesian inference approach allows us to obtain individual household estimates of utility parameters. Household utility estimates are used to compute the value of each variety. We compute a compensating value for the removal of each flavor; that is, we compute the monetary equivalent of the household's loss in utility from removal of a flavor. These calculations show that households highly value popular flavors and would incur substantial utility losses from removal of these flavors from the yogurt assortment. Next we consider the implications of our model for retailer assortment and pricing policies. Given limited shelf space, only a subset of the possible varieties can be displayed for purchase at any one time. If consumers value variety, then a retailer with lower variety must compensate the consumers in some way, such as a lower price level. We see this trade-off between price and variety across different retailing formats. Discount or warehouse format retailers often have both lower variety and lower prices. To measure this trade-off, we explore the utility loss from reduction in variety and find the reductions in price that will compensate for this utility loss. These price reduction calculations must be based on a valid utility structure. Heterogeneity in tastes is critical in these utility computations and policy experiments. We find that a relatively small fraction of households with extreme preferences dominate the compensating value computations. That is, some households are observed to purchase mostly or exclusively one variety. These households must be heavily compensated for the removal of this variety from the assortment. In some retailing contexts, customization of the assortment is possible at the customer level. We show that such customization virtually eliminates any utility loss from reduction in variety.},

  Abstract                 = {This paper analyzes the effects of the World Trade Organization (WTO) on trade among its members in its first decade of existence, 1995-2004. The analysis focuses on a key variable: the timing of membership. The paper examines how trade among WTO members was affected by the regime's accession rules and the timing of member's entry into the WTO. The paper distinguishes between founding members, or those who were members of the GATT as well as the WTO, the early adopters, those who entered the regime during the Uruguay Round or in the first year of the WTO's creation, and the later entrants who gained membership via the lengthy and complex accession process after 1995. The empirical analysis evaluates how WTO member trade has fared under the regime, both between members of the same group and between members of different groups. The paper assesses the effect of the WTO on trade creation, or the degree to which trade expanded after states entered into the regime. The results of the analysis show positive but divergent effects among the groups, suggesting that old and new members of the WTO have benefited in different ways from participation in the regime.},

  Abstract                 = {Voting patterns in the United National General Assembly provide an exceptionally good set of evidence for observing issues and alignments of states in international politics. We analyze those patterns in three post-cold war sessions of the General Assembly and compare them with the alignments and issues that characterized sessions during the cold war. We find new groups and alignments (with most of Eastern Europe now voting with rather than against West European positions) and a new prominence of long-term North-South issues as they now relate to questions of redefining "human security" in the post-cold war world. The predominant General Assembly division is between richer and poorer nations. Key correlates of voting with the North are wealth, democracy, and proportionately low levels of trade with the United States.},

  Abstract                 = {With a sample of nearly 900 voluntary associations, we give a detailed account of what membership benefits are provided by interest groups, and we place these results in the context of a typology of groups. Using a multivariate analysis of membership inducements, we show that the pursuit of collective goods by groups is not always a mere "by-product" made possible by the provision of selective material incentives, as Olson (1965) contended. Three things help groups overcome the collective goods dilemma: (1) members representing institutions are more likely than autonomous individuals to value the pursuit of collective goods; (2) group patrons and large donors who subsidize associations place a high value upon representation before government and are not interested in paying for benefits that are distributed to individual group members; and (3) once a threatening environment of policy conflict emerges, autonomous individuals are more likely to realize that cherished rights, programs, or group goals are threatened, and they are increasingly willing to join and support groups in exchange for only collective benefits. We also show that about half of the groups in Washington, DC, count institutions--not autonomous individuals--among their members, and we call for a theory of group membership that accounts for the differences among members.},

  Abstract                 = {One of the hallmarks of the development of political science as a discipline has been the creation of new methodologies by scholars within the discipline--methodologies that are well-suited to the analysis of political data. Gary King has been a leader in the development of these new approaches to the analysis of political data. In his book, Unifying Political Methodology, King shows how the likelihood theory of inference offers a unified approach to statistical modeling for political research and thus enables us to better analyze the enormous amount of data political scientists have collected over the years. Newly reissued, this book is a landmark in the development of political methodology and continues to challenge scholars and spark controversy. "Gary King's Unifying Political Methodology is at once an introduction to the likelihood theory of statistical inference and an evangelist's call for us to change our ways of doing political methodology. One need not accept the altar call to benefit enormously from the book, but the intellectual debate over the call for reformation is likely to be the enduring contribution of the work." --Charles Franklin, American Political Science Review "King's book is one of the only existing books which deal with political methodology in a clear and consistent framework. The material in it is now and will continue to be essential reading for all serious students and researchers in political methodology." --R. Michael Alvarez, California Institute of Tech-nology Gary King is Professor of Government, Harvard University.

  Abstract                 = {We propose a remedy for the discrepancy between the way political scientists analyze data with missing values and the recommendations of the statistics community. Methodologists and statisticians agree that "multiple imputation" is a superior approach to the problem of missing data scattered through one's explanatory and dependent variables than the methods currently used in applied data analysis. The discrepancy occurs because the computational algorithms used to apply the best multiple imputation models have been slow, difficult to implement, impossible to run with existing commercial statistical packages, and have demanded considerable expertise. We adapt an algorithm and use it to implement a general-purpose, multiple imputation model for missing data. This algorithm is considerably faster and easier to use than the leading method recommended in the statistics literature. We also quantify the risks of current missing data practices, illustrate how to use the new procedure, and evaluate this alternative through simulated data as well as actual empirical examples. Finally, we offer easy-to-use software that implements all methods discussed.},

  Abstract                 = {Despite widespread recognition that aggregated summary statistics on international conflict and cooperation miss most of the complex interactions among nations, the vast majority of scholars continue to employ annual, quarterly, or (occasionally) monthly observations. Daily events data, coded from some of the huge volume of news stories produced by journalists, have not been used much for the past two decades. We offer some reason to change this practice, which we feel should lead to considerably increased use of these data. We address advances in event categorization schemes and software programs that automatically produce data by &ldquo;reading&rdquo; news stories without human coders. We design a method that makes it feasible, for the first time, to evaluate these programs when they are applied in areas with the particular characteristics of international conflict and cooperation data, namely event categories with highly unequal prevalences, and where rare events (such as highly conflictual actions) are of special interest. We use this rare events design to evaluate one existing program, and find it to be as good as trained human coders, but obviously far less expensive to use. For large-scale data collections, the program dominates human coding. Our new evaluative method should be of use in international relations, as well as more generally in the field of computational linguistics, for evaluating other automated information extraction tools. We believe that the data created by programs similar to the one we evaluated should see dramatically increased use in international relations research. To facilitate this process, we are releasing with this article data on 3.7 million international events, covering the entire world for the past decade.},

  Abstract                 = {Inferences about counterfactuals are essential for prediction, answering "what if" questions, and estimating causal effects. However, when the counterfactuals posed are too far from the data at hand, conclusions drawn from well-specified statistical analyses become based on speculation and convenient but indefensible model assumptions rather than empirical evidence. Unfortunately, standard statistical approaches assume the veracity of the model rather than revealing the degree of model-dependence, so this problem can be hard to detect. We develop easy-to-apply methods to evaluate counterfactuals that do not require sensitivity testing over specified classes of models. If an analysis fails the tests we offer, then we know that substantive results are sensitive to at least some modeling choices that are not based on empirical evidence. We use these methods to evaluate the extensive scholarly literatures on the effects of changes in the degree of democracy in a country (on any dependent variable) and separate analyses of the effects of UN peacebuilding efforts. We find evidence that many scholars are inadvertently drawing conclusions based more on modeling hypotheses than on evidence in the data. For some research questions, history contains insufficient information to be our guide. Free software that accompanies this paper implements all our suggestions.},

  Abstract                 = {We study rare events data, binary dependent variables with dozens to thousands of times fewer ones (events, such as wars, vetoes, cases of political activism, or epidemiological infections) than zeros ("nonevents"). In many literatures, these variables have proven difficult to explain and predict, a problem that seems to have at least two sources. First, popular statistical procedures, such as logistic regression, can sharply underestimate the probability of rare events. We recommend corrections that outperform existing methods and change the estimates of absolute and relative risks by as much as some estimated effects reported in the literature. Second, commonly used data collection strategies are grossly inefficient for rare events data. The fear of collecting data with too few events has led to data collections with huge numbers of observations but relatively few, and poorly measured, explanatory variables, such as in international conflict data with more than a quarter-million dyads, only a few of which are at war. As it turns out, more efficient sampling designs exist for making valid inferences, such as sampling all available events (e.g., wars) and a tiny fraction of nonevents (peace). This enables scholars to save as much as 99\% of their (nonfixed) data collection costs or to collect much more meaningful explanatory variables. We provide methods that link these two results, enabling both types of corrections to work simultaneously, and software that implements the methods developed.},

  Abstract                 = { This paper began as a Cold War detective story and became a personal obsession of its author over the course of the past decade. The author became aware of its subject, M. Osipov, when he was working on a monograph on Foresight and Forecasting in the Russian and Soviet Military. Mentions of Osipov's work by Soviet scholars drew attention to the original publication of his article in Voenniy sbornik [Military Digest] in 1915. Allen Rehm and Robert Helmhold, who translated the article into English, addressed Osipov's contribution to operations research and noted the parallels between his work and that of F. W. Lanchester. This article also addresses Osipov's unique contribution to operations research and proposes a solution to the unanswered question of the Osipov's identity. },

  Abstract                 = {This article analyzes various pitfalls that arise in the application of panel data methods in comparative political economy. Empirically, we refer to the debate on the globalization-welfare state nexus by re-assessing a study by Garrett and Mitchell ('Globalization, Government Spending and Taxation in the OECD', European Journal of Political Research 39(1) (2001): 1452013177). We discuss the properties of specifications with time invariate political variables, dynamic models with nonstationary data, and autocorrelated residuals. We demonstrate that the findings of previous empirical studies are often driven by mis-specifications. Presenting a statistically well-behaved model, we find evidence that government spending is primarily driven by the state of the domestic economy. Neither partisan effects nor the international economic environment have affected public expenditure considerably.},

We examine the 66 regular articles appearing in the 2004 issues of Journal of Economic Theoryââthe leading journal in economic theoryâ âand apply the three requirements. We make the assessment accountable by formulating six sub- tests and recording our scores in a detailed spreadsheet linked as an appendix; anyone may spot-check the spreadsheet to see if an article was scored unfairly. We find that 27 articles fail the first test (Theory of what?) and 58 articles fail at least one of the three requirements. Thus, 88 percent of the articles do not qualify as theory. (The âpassâ rates would be even lower if one were to exclude the special issue, and if one were to include the short notes.) We contend that the journalâs claim to scientific status is doubtful, as well as the very title of the journal. A truer title would be, Journal of Economic Model Building. More generally, we challenge calling model building âtheory.â},

This computerized content analysis technique is a potentially powerful tool for scholars interested in the study of political elites, since it promises an easy and efficient way of inferring policy position from texts and speeches. In this article, we provide a systematic evaluation of this promising method. Using Danish manifestos and government speeches from 1945 to 2005, we compare the policy positions extracted using Wordscores with measures of positions from the well-known Comparative Manifesto Project and cross-validate these with party expert surveys. Our analysis shows that the word scoring technique arrives at largely similar estimates to independently derived position measures and produces time series of government positions with high face validity.

We find that the elasticity of substitution lies below unity at 0.7, that labor-augmenting technical progress is dominant in the long run while capital-augmenting technical progress plays an important role in the interim period. Importantly, we also find evidence of a structural break in the pattern of biased technical progress towards the end of the 1990s. Our results help to solve two puzzles in Europeâs recent growth experience which differ markedly from the US experience. The first is related to the effects of the IT boom in the 1990s on productivity growth in Europe. The second puzzle concerns the changes in the âOkunâs lawâ relationship, linking growth to the reduction of unemployment, which are observable in Europe since the late 1990s.},

  Abstract                 = {Politics reflects a seemingly incontrovertible condition-any imaginable human population is diverse across multiple, overlapping dimensions including material interests, moral and ethical commitments, and cultural attachments. Such diversity means, in turn, that disagreement and conflict are unavoidable. Under these circumstances politics largely consists in contests over the contours Of shared institutional arrangements. Given that there almost always are a number of ways to institutionalize social interaction, any population occupying the circumstances of politics must determine which institutional form or arrangement to rely on in any particular domain. The "priority" of democracy, on our account, derives from its usefulness in approaching this crucial task. This priority derives front,features that are, in our view, unique to democracy, namely a level of reflexivity that distinguishes it from other ways of coordinating ongoing social interaction. As we demonstrate, much of the literature on social institutions tacitly and improperly privileges a quite different component of our institutional arrangements, namely markets. We show that once one clarifies the premises and argumentative strategies common to this literature, it simply is not possible to sustain the privilege it accords to markets. In fact, we argue that the analytical models and explanatory strategies that institutionalists deploy actually sustain our case for the priority of democracy.},

  Abstract                 = {We begin by positing a conception of pragmatism that is characterized by three basic philosophical commitments: consequentialism, fallibilism, and anti-skepticism. In light of that conception we challenge prevalent views that hold that pragmatism entails no particular moral and political positions. We argue instead that pragmatism generally has democratic implications and, more specifically, that it has implications for the assessment and justification of political institutions. To develop this position we draw in part on the political insights of Dewey. Dewey argued that the greater social and economic complexity of twentieth century life creates significant problems for democratic society and its institutions. The most important of these problems is that growing complexity makes it difficult far a democratic public to effectively identify either itself or its enduring interests. In lieu of a specific remedy Dewey proposed a form of social inquiry that can, by entering into democratic deliberation, contribute to the process by which the public might more readily define its common interests and, thereby, itself We argue that rational choice theory can assist us in undertaking such a pragmatist social inquiry. We draw on two main bodies of recent research-on the political economy of U.S. macroeconomic policy and on mechanism design-to show the relevance of the rational choice approach. We argue both that this research reinforces pragmatist preoccupation with democratic deliberation and, because pragmatists are naive about institutional matters, that their preoccupation is very nearly utopian in the pejorative sense.},

  Abstract                 = {Most research on democracy and trade policy indicates that democracies are more liberal than autocracies. I argue, in contrast, that the effects of democracy on trade policy vary across trading partners. Because the typical median voter has a low capital endowment relative to the national mean, (s)he benefits from trade with relatively capital-abundant countries but is hurt by trade with relatively labor-abundant ones. Democracy, which increases the median voterâs influence, thus leads to trade liberalization with wealthier countries but increased protection against poorer ones. I test and find support for this hypothesis using dyadic trade flows from 1950-2000 and dyadic trade barriers in the 1990s. My results imply that democratization has led and will lead to discrimination in international trade, primarily via nontariff barriers. The spread of democracy thus heightens the need for multilateral trading rules that combat the discriminatory use of such measures.},

  Abstract                 = {This paper develops a new approach to change-point modeling that allows for an unknown number of change points in the observed sample. Our model assumes that regime durations have a Poisson distribution. The model approximately nests the two most commonapproaches: the time-varying parameter model with a change point every period and the change-point model with a small number of regimes. We focus on the construction of reasonable hierarchical priors both for regime durations and for the parameters that characterize each regime. A Markov Chain Monte Carlo posterior sampler is constructed to estimate a change-point model for conditional means and variances. We find that our techniques work well in an empirical exercise involving U.S. inflation and GDP growth.Empirical results suggest that the number of change points is larger than previously stimated in these series and the implied model is similar to a time-varying parameter model with stochastic volatility},

We show how two popular priors have some potentially undesirable properties, such as allocating excessive prior weight to change points near the end of the sample. We discuss how these properties relate to imposing a fixed number of change points in the sample. In our study, we develop a hierarchical approach that allows some change points to occur out of the sample. We show that this prior has desirable properties and handles cases with unknown change points. Our hierarchical approach can be shown to nest a wide variety of change-point models, from time-varying parameter models to those with few or no breaks. Data-based learning about the parameter that controls this variety occurs because our prior is hierarchical.},

SsfPack allows for a full range of different state space forms: from a simple time-invariant model to a complicated time-varying model. Functions can be used which put standard models such as ARMA and cubic spline models in state space form. Basic functions are available for filtering, moment smoothing and simulation smoothing. Ready-to-use functions are provided for standard tasks such as likelihood evaluation, forecasting and signal extraction. We show that SsfPack can be easily used for implementing, fitting and analysing Gaussian models relevant to many areas of econometrics and statistics. Some Gaussian illustrations are given.},

  Abstract                 = {How can states credibly make and keep agreements when they are uncertain about the distributional implications of their cooperation? They can do so by incorporating the proper degree of flexibility into their agreements. I develop a formal model in which an agreement characterized by uncertainty may be renegotiated to incorporate new information. The uncertainty is related to the division of gains under the agreement, with the parties resolving this uncertainty over time as they gain experience with the agreement. The greater the agreement uncertainty, the more likely states will want to limit the duration of the agreement and incorporate renegotiation. Working against renegotiation is noise-that is, variation in outcomes not resulting from the agreement. The greater the noise, the more difficult it is to learn how an agreement is actually working; hence, incorporating limited duration and renegotiation provisions becomes less valuable. In a detailed case study, I demonstrate that the form of uncertainty in my model corresponds to that experienced by the parties to the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, who adopted the solution my model predicts.},

  Abstract                 = {The literature on the benefits and costs of financial globalization for developing countries has exploded in recent years, but along many disparate channels and with a variety of apparently conflicting results. For instance, there is still little robust evidence of the growth benefits of broad capital account liberalization, but a number of recent papers in the finance literature report that equity market liberalizations do significantly boost growth. Similarly, evidence based on microeconomic (firm- or industry-level) data shows some benefits of financial integration and the distortionary effects of capital controls, while the macroeconomic evidence remains inconclusive. We attempt to provide a unified conceptual framework for organizing this vast and growing literature. This framework allows us to provide a fresh synthetic perspective on the macroeconomic effects of financial globalization, in terms of both growth and volatility. Overall, our critical reading of the recent empirical literature is that it lends some qualified support to the view that developing countries can benefit from financial globalization, but with many nuances. On the other hand, there is little systematic evidence to support widely cited claims that financial globalization by itself leads to deeper and more costly developing country growth crises.},

  Abstract                 = {We consider a continuous-time model for the evolution of social networks. A social network is here conceived as a (di-) graph on a set of vertices, representing actors, and the changes of interest are creation and disappearance over time of (arcs) edges in the graph. Hence we model a collection of random edge indicators that are not, in general, independent. We explicitly model the interdependencies between edge indicators that arise from interaction between social entities. A Markov chain is defined in terms of an embedded chain with holding times and transition probabilities. Data are observed at fixed points in time and hence we are not able to observe the embedded chain directly. Introducing a prior distribution for the parameters we may implement an MCMC algorithm for exploring the posterior distribution of the parameters by simulating the evolution of the embedded process between observations.},

  Abstract                 = {Would holding elections by mail increase voter turnout? Many electoral reform advocates predict that mail ballot elections will boost participation, basing their prediction on the high turnout rate among absentee voters and on the rise in voter turnout after Oregon switched to voting by mail. However, selection problems inherent to studies of absentee voters and Oregon give us important reasons to doubt whether their results would extend to more general applications of voting by mail. In this paper, we isolate the effects of voting in mail ballot elections by taking advantage of a natural experiment in which voters are assigned in a nearly random process to cast their ballots by mail. We use matching methods to ensure that, in our analysis, the demographic characteristics of these voters mirror those of polling-place voters who take part in the same elections. Drawing on data from a large sample of California counties in two general elections, we find that voting by mail does not deliver on the promise of greater participation in general elections. In fact, voters who are assigned to vote by mail turn out at lower rates than those who are sent to a polling place. Analysis of a sample of local special elections, by contrast, indicates that voting by mail can increase turnout in these otherwise low-participation contests.},

  Abstract                 = {The acceptance of human rights and minority rights, the increasing role of international financial institutions, and globalization have led many observers to question the continued viability of the sovereign state. Here a leading expert challenges this conclusion. Stephen Krasner contends that states have never been as sovereign as some have supposed. Throughout history, rulers have been motivated by a desire to stay in power, not by some abstract adherence to international principles. Organized hypocrisy--the presence of longstanding norms that are frequently violated--has been an enduring attribute of international relations Political leaders have usually but not always honored international legal sovereignty, the principle that international recognition should be accorded only to juridically independent sovereign states, while treating Westphalian sovereignty, the principle that states have the right to exclude external authority from their own territory, in a much more provisional way. In some instances violations of the principles of sovereignty have been coercive, as in the imposition of minority rights on newly created states after the First World War or the successor states of Yugoslavia after 1990; at other times cooperative, as in the European Human Rights regime or conditionality agreements with the International Monetary Fund. The author looks at various issues areas to make his argument: minority rights, human rights, sovereign lending, and state creation in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries. Differences in national power and interests, he concludes, not international norms, continue to be the most powerful explanation for the behavior of states.},

  Abstract                 = {A dynamic systems model of administrative politics that (1) relaxes restrictive causal assumptions among the president, Congress, and an administrative agency, (2) emphasizes aggregate institutional behavior, and (3) analyzes both anticipated and unanticipated policy behavior is set forth as a more general means to investigate agency-political relationships. The main set of hypotheses focus on the aggregate institutional relationships among the president, Congress, and administrative agency. These four possible hypotheses include bureaucratic influence, bureaucratic autonomy, mutual influence, and political influence. The purpose here is to assess the relative merits of competing explanations for bureaucratic behavior. Securities regulation is a perfect area of inquiry to investigate these competing perspectives since the findings of existing research on this topic are disparate. Vector autoregressive time series statistical methods are used to empirically test the dynamic systems model of administrative politics by examining three empirical models of SEC enforcement behavior in relation to presidential and congressional budgetary preference signals for the 1949-92 annual period. The SEC sends potent signals of their own (via their changes in regulatory outputs) that will affect the budgetary preferences of its political principles. However, the SEC's administrative outputs are shown to be somewhat less sensitive to political budgetary preference signals than what one would expect. Presidential and congressional budgetary preference signals (with respect to the SEC) are interdependent to a sizeable extent, thus raising doubts about the separate, independent effect democratic institutions have over the bureaucracy. The implications of this study suggest that conventional theories of agency-political relations serve as an oversimplified way to study administrative behavior. Future research on this topic must consider the behavior of each governmental institution as being a function of a dynamic interrelated process among one another.},

  Abstract                 = { We offer a theory of intertemporal bureaucratic decision making which proposes that an agency&apos;s forecast optimism is related to the extent to which it discounts future reputation costs associated with bureaucratic incompetence. Agency forecasts of the distant future are more likely to be optimistic than short-term forecasts. We claim that unstable organizations will discount reputation costs at a steeper rate than stable organizations, and therefore will produce more optimistic forecasts. We test our theory using macroeconomic forecasts produced by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) and the Social Security Administration (SSA) across six forecast horizons from 1979 to 2003. The statistical results are generally consistent with our theory: OMB generates more optimistic long-term forecasts than SSA. Further, differences in forecast optimism between these executive branch agencies widen as the forecast horizon increases. Our evidence suggests that more stable agencies place a premium on minimizing reputation costs. Conversely, less stable agencies are more likely to accommodate political pressures for forecast optimism. These findings underscore the importance of institutional design for understanding how executive agencies balance the conflicting goals of political responsiveness and bureaucratic competence within the administrative state.},

Mapping covert networks to prevent criminal activity is much more difficult. We examine the network surrounding the tragic events of September 11th, 2001. Through public data we are able to map a portion of the network centered around the 19 dead hijackers. This map gives us some insight into the terrorist organization, yet it is incomplete. Suggestions for further work and research are offered.},

The model strikes a balance between previous formal models that predict either excessive gridlock or excessive policy responsiveness as a consequence of the politics of appointments. I test the model using approximately four decades of data on U.S. Supreme Court appointments. Two hypotheses summarize the unique predictions of the model and are strongly corroborated. A third, less distinctive hypothesis about strategic judicial retirements is weakly supported.},

  Abstract                 = {Dictatorships are not all the same: some ban political parties and shut down legislature once in power and rule exclusively by force and terror, while others create a full set of seemingly democratic institutions and rarely repress, and again others have neither parties nor legislatures but nevertheless show full respect for their citizens physical integrity. To explain this diversity and show how it depends on the level of income inequality, I develop a model in which a small group of rich hold power and may face a revolutionary threat from the large group of poor excluded from power. The rich have two instruments to prevent being swept from power by revolution: they can either choose to make a credible policy concession by creating a multiparty legislature that limits their executive power or use repression. I show that for low levels of inequality the rich will make no concession offer and will not use repression, since the revolutionary threat is low. At medium levels of inequality, the cost of making some credible policy concessions are lower than using repression, which is why the rich opt for concessions. At high levels of inequality, the cost of making a concession offer that pleases the poor is greater than the cost of repression, so the rich choose the latter. Hence, the model claims that Ã¢â¬ÅpeacefulÃ¢â¬ï¿½ autocracies, semi- autocracies and repressive autocracies occur at different levels of inequality. Using data on a sample of 98 dictatorships between 1950 and 1996, I test this prediction using a zero-inflated and regular ordered probit models. The results strongly support my models predictions.},

  Abstract                 = {This paper pursues two goals: first, to move beyond existing analyses of the effects of general trade openness on national or international environmental policy by developing and testing more specific hypotheses on dyadic trade effects on international policy-outcomes (i.e., problem solving); and second, to test these hypotheses based on the best available national and subnational spacial data and new techniques (notably, GIS) for constructing datasets that allow for direct testing of hypotheses on transboundary (instead of national level) outcomes. We develop two hypotheses and test them for transboundary water pollution, an environmental outcome variable reflecting success or failure in international water management: (1) that the intensity of bilateral (dyadic) trade ties has a positive effect on international environmental problem solving; and (2) that asymmetry of trade ties in favor of the downstream country is conducive to problem solving in upstream-downstream settings because it balances positional power (upstream) with economic power (downstream). Our dependent variable is water quality, specifically, concentrations of water pollutants from point (BOD5) and non-point sources (NO3-). The dataset for major international rivers from 1970-2003 was constructed with the help of GIS and data from the Global Environmental Monitoring System (GEMS), the European Environmental Agency (EEA), and other sources. Neither the first nor the second hypothesis receives robust empirical support: trade ties do not seem to help in reducing transboundary water pollution, nor do they seem to hinder such efforts. We discuss several possible reasons for this finding and outline options for further research.},

  Abstract                 = {Many interesting phenomena (electoral competition, R&D races, lobbying) are instances of multiple simultaneous contests with unconditional commitment of limited resources. Specifically, the following game is analyzed. Two players compete in a number of simultaneous contests. The players have limited resources (budgets) and must decide how to allocate these to the different contests. In each contest the player who expends more resources than his adversary wins a corresponding prize. Mixed-strategy equilibria are characterized in the case of identical values and budgets and the connections with the classical Blotto game are analyzed.},

This article presents a game theoretic model of mediation drawing on the theory of "cheap talk" which highlights a contrary logic. Conflict arises in bargaining games because of uncertainty about the resolve of the parties. A mediator can reduce the likelihood of conflict by providing information on this score. For a mediator to be effective, however, the parties must believe that the mediator is telling the truth, especially if the mediator counsels one side to make a concession because their opponent has high resolve and will fight. An unbiased mediator who is simply interested in minimizing the probability of conflict will have a strong incentive to make such statements even if they are not true, hence the parties will not find the mediator credible. Only mediators who are effectively "on your side" will be believed if they counsel restraint.},

These attacks were designed to undermine andhalt what extremist groups viewed as the humiliating and misguidedPalestinian Israeli peace process, and within three months they hadachieved this goal. On 26 May 1996 Israelis replaced Prime MinisterShimon Peres with the more hawkish Benjamin Netanyahu, and soonthereafter negotiations between Israel and the Palestinian Authoritystalled. Although the bombings were clearly the work of a small band ofPalestinian extremists, these extremists were able to convince amajority of Israeli citizens to walk away from a peace process most ofthem strongly supported.},

  Abstract                 = {Mediation is one of the most widespread techniques for preventing conflict and promoting cooperation. I examine the conditions under which mediators can facilitate cooperation by building trust between two parties. Assuming mediators have no intrinsic commitment to honesty, they can be credible trust builders in one-round interactions only if they care about the issue at stake, have a moderate ideal point, and do not find conflict to be too costly. A mediator that is solely interested in promoting cooperation, or one that is biased toward one side, will be ineffective. A desire to preserve a reputation for honesty can overcome a limited amount of bias or issue indifference.},

We use this powerful instrument to obtain estimates of the causal impact of openness on democratization. A positive impact of openness on democracy is apparent from about 1895 onwards. Late nineteenth century trade globalization may have helped generate the "first wave" of democratization. Between 1920 and 1938 countries more exposed to international trade were less likely to become authoritarian. Finally, our post-World War II results suggest that a one standard deviation increase in trade with other countries could bring countries like Indonesia, Russia or Venezuela to be as democratic as the US, Great Britain or France. We also see some variation in the impact of openness by region and note that commodity exporters and petroleum producers do not seem to become more democratic by exporting more of such items.},

First, we summarize the pre-game theoretic competitive bidding literature based on decision theory and the associated empirical work, centered essentially around the winner's curse debate. Then, we review the main distribution free predictions of the three major game theoretic models, the identification of their stochastic structure, and their confrontation with data. We study successively, the symmetric common value model, the independent private values model and the asymmetric common value model. Conditional upon being in one of these models, game theoretic restrictions can be tested. A major conclusion is that predictions are highly dependent on the unobservable restrictions on the distributions of characteristics. The paper concludes with a suggestion to develop a structural econometrics of auction data with only a few restrictions on these distributions.},

  Abstract                 = {In this paper we propose an estimation method for the empirical study of theoretical auction models. We focus on first-price sealed bid and descending auctions and we adopt the private value paradigm, where each bidder is assumed to have a different private value, only known to him, for the object that is auctioned. Following McFadden (1989) and Pakes and Pollard (1989), our proposed method is based on simulations. Specifically, the method relies on a simulated nonlinear least squares objective function appropriately adjusted so as to obtain consistent estimates of the parameters of interest. We illustrate the proposed method by studying a market of agricultural products, where descending auctions are used. Our analysis takes into account heterogeneity of the auctioned objects and the fact that only the winning bid is observed. We estimate the parameters that characterize the distribution of the unobserved private values for each auctioned object.},

  Abstract                 = { Record linkage, or exact matching, can be used to join together two files that contain information on the same individuals but lack unique personal identification codes. The possibility of errors in linkage causes problems for estimating the relationships between variables on the two files. The effect is analogous to the impact of measurement error. A model of a linear regression relationship between variables in linked files is proposed. Assuming the probabilities that pairs of records are links are known, an unbiased estimator of the regression coefficients is derived. Methods for estimating the linkage probabilities by using mixture models are discussed. A consistent estimator of the covariance matrix of the proposed estimator is proposed. A bootstrap estimator is used to reflect the impact of the uncertainty in record linkage model parameters on the estimators of the regression parameters. A simulation study compares the performance of the proposed estimator and alternatives. },

  Abstract                 = {Why do states delegate certain tasks and responsibilities to international organizations rather than acting unilaterally or cooperating directly? Furthermore, to what extent do states continue to control IOs once authority has been delegated? Examining a variety of different institutions including the World Trade Organization, the United Nations and the European Commission, this book explores the different methods that states employ to ensure their interests are being served, and identifies the problems involved with monitoring and managing IOs. The contributors suggest that it is not inherently more difficult to design effective delegation mechanisms at international level than at domestic level and, drawing on principal-agent theory, help explain the variations that exist in the extent to which states are willing to delegate to IOs. They argue that IOs are neither all evil nor all virtuous, but are better understood as bureaucracies that can be controlled to varying degrees by their political masters. },

The problem takes many forms; learning vocabulary from text is an especially dramatic and convenient case for research. A new general theory of acquired similarity and knowledge representation, Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA), is presented and used to successfully simulate such learning and several other psycholinguistic phenomena. By inducing global knowledge indirectly from local co-occurrence data in a large body of representative text, LSA acquired knowledge about the full vocabulary of English at a comparable rate to school-children. LSA uses no prior linguistic or perceptual similarity knowledge; it is based solely on a general mathematical learning method that achieves powerful inductive effects by extracting the right number of dimensions (e.g., 300) to represent objects and contexts. Relations to other theories, phenomena, and problems are sketched.},

The underlying idea is that the aggregate of all the word contexts in which a given word does and does not appear provides a set of mutual constraints that largely determines the similarity of meaning of words and sets of words to each other. The adequacy of LSAâs reflection of human knowledge has been established in a variety of ways. For example, its scores overlap those of humans on standard vocabulary and subject matter tests; it mimics human word sorting and category judgments; it simulates wordâword and passageâword lexical priming data; and, as reported in 3 following articles in this issue, it accurately estimates passage coherence, learnability of passages by individual students, and the quality and quantity of knowledge contained in an essay.},

To answer this question we develop a war and bargaining model that integrates a dynamic progression of the war and allows the rivals to make offers at any time of their choosing while they fight. The model predicts that, in equilibrium, states choose to fight without making significant offers in the hope that the other side will give in to outstanding demands. The model also predicts that each sideâs flow cost of war increases with the probability that the other side gives in to its demands. This is the testable consequence of attrition behavior. Our statistical analysis suggests that both challenger and defender include attrition behavior in their conduct of warfare, and that this behavioral element significantly affects the duration of interstate wars.},

Fighting ends with the compromise that reveals the other side's type. This article shows that, if the protagonists are free to fight and bargain in the time continuum, they no longer make increasing concessions in an attempt to end the war promptly and on fair terms. Instead, the rivals stand firm on extreme bargaining positions, fighting it out in the hope that the other side will give in, until much of the war has been fought. Despite ongoing resolution of uncertainty by virtue of time passing, the rivals choose not to try to narrow their differences by negotiating. },

  Abstract                 = {The goal of record linkage is to link quickly and accurately records that correspond to the same person or entity. Whereas certain patterns of agreements and disagreements on variables are more likely among records pertaining to a single person than among records for different people, the observed patterns for pairs of records can be viewed as arising from a mixture of matches and nonmatches. Mixture model estimates can be used to partition record pairs into two or more groups that can be labeled as probable matches (links) and probable nonmatches (nonlinks). A method is proposed and illustrated that uses marginal information in the database to select mixture models, identifies sets of records for clerks to review based on the models and marginal information, incorporates clerically reviewed data, as they become available, into estimates of model parameters, and classifies pairs as links, nonlinks, or in need of further clerical review. The procedure is illustrated with five datasets from the U.S. Bureau of the Census. It appears to be robust to variations in record-linkage sites. The clerical review corrects classifications of some pairs directly and leads to changes in classification of others through reestimation of mixture models.},

  Abstract                 = {Ideal point estimators are typically based on an assumption that all legislators are equally responsive to modeled dimensions of legislative disagreement; however, particularistic constituency interests and idiosyncrasies of individual legislators introduce variation in the degree to which legislators cast votes predictably. I introduce a Bayesian heteroskedastic ideal point estimator and demonstrate by Monte Carlo simulation that it outperforms standard homoskedastic estimators at recovering the relative positions of legislators. In addition to providing a refinement of ideal point estimates, the heteroskedastic estimator recovers legislator-specific error variance parameters that describe the extent to which each legislator's voting behavior is not conditioned on the primary axes of disagreement in the legislature. Through applications to the roll call histories of the U.S. Congress, the E.U. Parliament, and the U.N. General Assembly, I demonstrate how to use the heteroskedastic estimator to study substantive questions related to legislative incentives for low-dimensional voting behavior as well as diagnose unmodeled dimensions and nonconstant ideal points.},

Retrospective estimation of these positions in past party systems will require a method for estimating policy positions from political texts. Previous hand-coding content analysis schemes deal with policy emphasis rather than policy positions. We propose a new hand-coding scheme for policy positions, together with a new English language computer-coding scheme that is compatible with this. We apply both schemes to party manifestos from Britain and Ireland in 1992 and 1997 and cross validate the resulting estimates with those derived from quite independent expert surveys and with previous manifesto analyses. There is a high degree of cross validation between coding methods, including computer coding. This implies that it is indeed possible to use computer-coded content analysis to derive reliable and valid estimates of policy positions from political texts. This will allow vast volumes of text to be coded, including texts generated by individuals and other internal party actors, allowing the empirical elaboration of dynamic rather than static models of party competition that move beyond the unitary actor assumption.},

We aim to complete previous asymptotic results by constructing algorithms that can be used in diverse practical situations. First, we propose an adaptive choice of the penalty function for automatically estimating the dimension of the model, i.e., the number of change points. In a Bayesian framework, we define the posterior distribution of the change-point sequence as a function of the penalized contrast. \{MCMC\} procedures are available for sampling this posterior distribution. The parameters of this distribution are estimated with a stochastic version of \{EM\} algorithm (SAEM). An application to \{EEG\} analysis and some Monte-Carlo experiments illustrate these algorithms. },

  Abstract                 = {Economists have devoted relatively little attention to analyzing how government officials actually enforce regulation. This is a significant omission, since the efficacy of regulatory enforcement and the effects of regulation on economic outcomes may depend on how regulators regulate. This article sheds light on these issues by examining how the fledgling Food and Drug Administration (FDA) enforced the Pure Food and Drugs Act from 1907 to 1938. I argue that because the FDA's ability to enforce this law through deterrence was limited, effective enforcement could be obtained only in those instances where the agency had the capacity to offer benefits to compliant firms in the way of quality certification or direct assistance in improving product quality. The available evidence on the FDA's enforcement activities is consistent with this prediction. The analysis presented may help to explain why contemporary regulatory agencies spend considerable resources on advisory enforcement activities.},

  Abstract                 = {We formulate a new game-theoretic model of bargaining on the US Supreme Court. In the model, a degree of monopoly power over policy endogenously accrues to the assigned writer despite an "open rule" permitting other justices to make counteroffers. We assume justices are motivated ultimately by a concern for judicial policy, but that the policy impact of an opinion depends partly on its persuasiveness, clarity, and craftsmanship--its legal quality. The effort cost of producing a high-quality opinion creates a wedge that the assignee can exploit to move an opinion from the median without provoking a winning counteroffer. We use this bargaining model as the foundation for a formal analysis of opinion assignment. Both the bargaining and opinion assignment models display rich and tractable comparative statics, allowing them to explain well-known empirical regularities, as well as to generate new propositions, all within a unified and internally consistent framework.},

  Abstract                 = {Time-varying relationships and volatility are two methodological challenges that are particular to the field of time series. In the case of the former, more comprehensive understanding can emerge when we ask under what circumstances relationships may change. The impact of context-such as the political environment, the state of the economy, the international situation, etc.-is often missing in dynamic analyses that estimate time-invariant parameters. In addition, time-varying volatility presents a number of challenges including threats to inference if left unchecked. Among time-varying parameter models, the Dynamic Conditional Correlation (DCC) model is a creative and useful approach that deals effectively with over-time variation in both the mean and variance of time series. The DCC model allows us to study the evolution of relationships over time in a multivariate setting by relaxing model assumptions and offers researchers a chance to reinvigorate understandings that are tested using time series data. We demonstrate the method's potential in the first example by showing how the importance of subjective evaluations of the economy are not constant, but vary considerably over time as predictors of presidential approval. A second example using international dyadic time series data shows that the story of movement and comovement is incomplete without an understanding of the dynamics of their variance as well as their means.},

It examines the average directional agreement between early and late ACDA and SIPRI spending estimates for a full sample of countries and for seven different regions (Africa, East Asia, Latin America, Middle East, South Asia, NATO Europe, and the Warsaw Pact). It shows that the direction of ACDA and SIPRI estimates diverge significantly over time and that the two data sources appear especially challenged when estimating the sign of smaller, and especially negative, growth-rate changes and of spending in regions (Africa and the Middle East) where growth-rates vary markedly. It further establishes that, when a single source publishes consistent directional estimates, these estimates can diverge considerably from those published by the other source. Based on the findings, this study proposes a set of simple validation procedures and tests their strengths and weaknesses on various sets of countries.},

The findings reveal that systematic (or patterned) error for some regions is high and that unpatterned error for some regions is extremely high.

  Abstract                 = {Organizational learning is conceived apart from "inertia" by drawing from the literature on organizations and cognitive psychology. Organizational learning is predicted to be cumulative and specific (limited in space and time) rather than noncumulative or general (applied to diverse subjects and new tasks). It is also expected to reflect important subject and learner characteristics that are expressed in two competing models: the first assumes that subject difficulty impedes learning and the second assumes that apparent inhibitors actually facilitate learning. Correlations are examined among successive estimates of foreign military spending, for the same countries and years, published by the United States Arms Control and Disarmament Agency (ACDA). Learning scores, for different nations, are regressed on potential learning inhibitors and facilitators that are linked to the two models. Learning in ACDA is most convincingly shown to be specific (though cumulative and noncumulative). Learning appears to occur with moderate challenges and to be determined primarily by learner characteristics.},

To address that deficiency, this study analyzes the actions of the commission and its members' voting records in the 1977-2001 period. It establishes that targeting and punishment by the commission decreasingly fit the predictions of a realist perspective, in which naming and shaming is an inherently political exercise, and increasingly fit the predictions of a liberal "reputation" perspective, in which governments hold others to their promises, and a constructivist "social conformity" perspective, in which governments distribute and respond to social rewards and punishments. With the end of the Cold War, the commission's targeting and punishment of countries was based less on partisan ties, power politics, and the privileges of membership, and more on those countries' actual human rights violations, treaty commitments, and active participation in cooperative endeavors such as peacekeeping operations.},

Candidates who just barely won an election (barely became the incumbent) are likely to be ex ante comparable in all other ways to candidates who barely lost, and so their differential electoral outcomes in the next election should represent a true incumbency advantage. The regression discontinuity analysis provides striking evidence that incumbency has a significant causal effect of raising the probability of subsequent electoral success - by about 0.40 to 0.45. Simulations - using estimates from a structural model of individual voting behavior - imply that about two-thirds of the apparent electoral success of incumbents can be attributed to voters' valuation of politicians' experience. The quasi-experimental analysis also suggest that heuristic 'fixed effects' and 'instrumental variable' modeling approaches would have led to misleading inferences in this context.},

  Abstract                 = {Virtual worlds typically contain systems of resource allocation, production, and consumption, which are often called virtual economies. The operator of a virtual world clearly has an incentive to monitor the virtual economy, and users and outside observers would benefit from e.g. temporal or cross-economy comparisons. Standard methodology of computing macroeconomic aggregates for virtual economies would allow this kind of analysis, but such method is currently unavailable. This study fills this gap by employing the concepts of national accounting and unique log data from a virtual world. In particular, the focus is on virtual economies where the production of new virtual goods takes place as the users expend inputs to produce predetermined outputs along predetermined production paths. The major MMOGs fall into this category. Previous attempts on measuring the aggregate production of a virtual economy have been based on non-standard method and externally collected data. In virtual economies the operator can collect extensive data automatically, a characteristic feature that should be reflected in any standard accounting scheme. Macroeconomic aggregates for a national economy are computed using the UN System of National Accounts (SNA). It is a standard accounting system, and its probably most quoted outcome is the gross domestic product. The most relevant borderline in SNA lies between the national economy and the rest of the world: domestic production is included, whereas foreign production is not. SNA cannot be directly used in a virtual economy, as the concepts of "domestic" and "foreign" are not applicable. In this study, the concepts and methods of SNA are transferred to a virtual economy context. The relevant distinction in a virtual economy is made between production by the users and the creation of goods by the virtual world code. Application of the concepts of SNA and flow chart analysis result in an aggregate measure called the Gross User Product (GUP), which measures the value of the aggregate output of production activities â of both goods and services by the users of a virtual economy. In the empirical part of this study, the potential of GUP is demonstrated by measuring it for the virtual economy of EVE Online based on extensive log data collected by the operator. Temporal comparisons are performed after purging the GUP values from the effect of significant deflation using a chained Fischer index. A 50\% real growth per user is observed for the first half of the year 2007. The composition of GUP has remained rather stable during this period of significant growth. The concept of GUP is general, and it can be used for quantifying virtual economies other than that in EVE Online on the macro level.},

  Abstract                 = {We analyze financial market data in order to produce an ex-ante assessment of the economic consequences of war with Iraq. The novel feature of our analysis derives from the existence of a market for âSaddam Securities,â a new future traded on an online betting exchange that pays only if Saddam Hussein is ousted. A variety of tests suggest that this futureâs price provides a plausible estimate of the probability of war. The spot oil price has moved closely with the Saddam Security, suggesting that war raises oil prices by around \$10 per barrel. Futures prices imply that markets expect these large immediate disruptions to dissipate quickly, with prices returning to pre-war levels within about a year and a half. Evidence on the long-run effects is fragile, and while prices are probably expected to fall a little as a result of war, any â oil dividendâ will be minimal. We find large effects in equity markets: and war lowers the value of U.S. equities by around 15 percent. This effect is concentrated in the consumer discretionary sector, airlines and IT; the prospect of war bolsters the gold and energy sectors. Analyzing option prices, we find that the large estimated average effects of war reflect the market pricing in a range of different scenarios - a 70 percent probability that it will lead to market declines of 0 to 15 percent, a 20 percent chance of 15 to 30 percent declines, and a 10 percent risk of a fall in excess of 30 percent. Across countries, the most extreme effects are on the stock markets of Turkey, Israel, and several European nations. Countries that are highly enmeshed in the world economy, or net oil importers, are most likely to experience adverse effects from war.},

  Abstract                 = {There can be no reconciliation between Hutu and Tutsi without justice, and no justice without truth. This proposition holds true for all three states of former Belgian Africa. In Rwanda and Burundi, in particular, getting at the truth will remain problematic as long as the perpetrators of genocide readily cast themselves in the role of victims, and the victims, in turn, are seen as perpetrators by their enemies. Basic disagreements between Hutu and Tutsi about who committed genocide and why are traceable in part to the uncritical use of the term genocide to describe just about any type of ethnic violence, in part to the selective sifting of the evidence with a view to exonerating one group and condemning the other. Although Hutu and Tutsi are both guilty of genocide, the tendency to substitute collective guilt for individual culpability in the planning and execution of the killings can only result in distortion of the facts. There will be no peace in the Great Lakes region unless one takes seriously the task of shedding light on the circumstances, the scale and the consequences of the genocide of Hutu by Tutsi in Burundi (1972), of Tutsi and Hutu by Hutu in Rwanda (1994), and of Hutu by Tutsi in Congo (1996-1997).},

The received wisdom claims their joint identification is infeasible. We challenge that interpretation. Putting the new approach of &#8220;normalized&#8221; production functions at the heart of a Monte Carlo analysis we identify the conditions under which identification is feasible and robust. The key result is that jointly modeling the production function and first-order conditions is superior to single-equation approaches especially when merged with &#8220;normalization.&#8221; Our results will have fundamental implications for production-function estimation under non-neutral technical change, for understanding the empirical relevance of normalization and variability underlying past empirical studies.},

  Abstract                 = { ABSTRACT Studies of American politics, particularly legislative politics, rely heavily on measures of the partisanship of a district. We develop a measurement model for this concept, estimating partisanship in the absence of election-specific, short-term factors, such as national-level swings specific to particular elections, incumbency advantage, and home-state effects in presidential elections. We estimate the measurement model using electoral returns and district-level demographic characteristics spanning five decades (1952&#8211;2000), letting us assess how the distribution of district partisanship has changed over time, in response to population movements and redistricting, particularly via the creation of majority-minority districts. We validate the partisanship measure with an analysis of congressional roll-call data. The model is easily extended to incorporate other indicators of district partisanship, such as survey data. },

  Abstract                 = {According to a leading rationalist explanation, war can break out when a large, rapid shift of power causes a credible commitment problem. This mechanism does not specify how inefficient fighting can resolve this cause, so it is an incomplete explanation of war. We present a complete information model of war as a sequence of battles and show that although opportunities for a negotiated settlement arise throughout, the very desirability of peace creates a commitment problem that undermines its likelihood. Because players have incentives to settle as soon as possible, they cannot credibly threaten to fight long enough if an opponent launches a surprise attack. This decreases the expected duration and costs of war and causes mutual deterrence to fail. Fighting's destructiveness improves the credibility of these threats by decreasing the benefits from continuing the war and can eventually lead to peace. In equilibrium players can only terminate war at specific windows of opportunity and fighting results in escalating costs that can leave both players worse off at the time peace is negotiated than a full concession would have before the war began.},

  Abstract                 = {Many game-theoretic models of crisis bargaining find that under incomplete information, an initial offer is either accepted, or war occurs. However, this finding is odd in two ways: (a) empirically, there are many cases of an agreement being peacefully reached after a number of offers and counteroffers and (b) theoretically, it is not clear why a state would ever leave the bargaining table and opt for inefficient war. We analyze a model in which, as long as the dissatisfied state is not too impatient, equilibria exist in which an agreement is peacefully reached through the offer2013counteroffer process. Our results suggest that private information only leads to war in conjunction with other factors that are correlated with impatience, such as domestic political vulnerability, exogenous obstacles to the ability to make counteroffers rapidly, and bargaining tactics that create incentives to strike quickly or that lock the actors into war.},

  Abstract                 = {We examine the hold-up problem of price regulation and compare it with the monetary policy credibility problem. For both, reputational solutions are possible provided that the policymaker is sufficiently far-sighted, but the hold-up problem in regulation turns out to be more serious than the inflation bias problem in monetary policy. Even with far-sighted regulators, a reputational equilibrium with optimal investment is undermined if capital depreciates slowly and consumer demand increases slowly. These results make the Rogoff-delegation solution to the regulatory commitment problem especially attractive. The paper concludes with a short discussion linking these results to the empirical literature on utility regulatory regimes.},

  Abstract                 = {This paper develops a methodology for consistently estimating the relative weights in senator utility functions, despite the fact that senator ideologies are unobserved. The empirical results suggest that voter preferences are assigned only one quarter of the weight in senator utility functions. The national "party line" also has some influence, but the senator's own ideology is the primary determinant of roll-call voting patterns. These results cast doubt on the empirical relevance of the median voter theorem. Estimation of the model requires only roll-call voting data, making it widely applicable.},

  Abstract                 = {Agents are often better informed than the clients who hire them and may exploit this informational advantage. Real-estate agents, who know much more about the housing market than the typical homeowner, are one example. Because real estate agents receive only a small share of the incremental profit when a house sells for a higher value, there is an incentive for them to convince their clients to sell their houses too cheaply and too quickly. We test these predictions by comparing home sales in which real estate agents are hired by others to sell a home to instances in which a real estate agent sells his or her own home. In the former case, the agent has distorted incentives; in the latter case, the agent wants to pursue the first-best. Consistent with the theory, we find homes owned by real estate agents sell for about 3.7 percent more than other houses and stay on the market about 9.5 days longer, even after controlling for a wide range of housing characteristics. Situations in which the agent's informational advantage is larger lead to even greater distortions.},

It is concluded that the last two tasks are flawed because of the ambiguity of the concept of the offensive/defensive balance. There are multiple definitions and multiple hypotheses, but these are not interchangeable, particularly between the pre-nuclear and nuclear eras, where the concept means something fundamentally different. Hypotheses appropriate for one definition may be implausible or tautological for another. It is concluded that the notion of the offensive/defensive balance is too vague and encompassing to be useful in theoretical or historical analysis, but that some of the individual variables that have been incorporated under this broader concept may themselves be useful. Much more analysis is needed, however, to demonstrate that these concepts have important theoretical consequences.},

  Abstract                 = {Over the last 15 years a large amount of scholarship in legislative politics has used NOMINATE or other similar methods to construct measures of legislators' ideological locations. These measures are then used in subsequent analyses. Recent work in political methodology has focused on the pitfalls of using such estimates as variables in subsequent analysis without explicitly accounting for their uncertainty and possible bias ( Herron and Shotts 2003, Political Analysis 11:44-64). This presents a problem for those employing NOMINATE scores because estimates of their unconditional sampling uncertainty or bias have until now been unavailable. In this paper, we present a method of forming unconditional standard error estimates and bias estimates for NOMINATE scores using the parametric bootstrap. Standard errors are estimated for the 90th U.S. Senate in two dimensions. Standard errors of first-dimension placements are in the 0.03 to 0.08 range. The results are compared with those obtained using the Markov chain Monte Carlo estimator of Clinton et al. (2002, Stanford University Working Paper). We also show how the bootstrap can be used to construct standard errors and confidence intervals for auxiliary quantities of interest such as ranks and the location of the median senator.},

We compare this estimator to one based on a symmetric information version of the same game, using the quantal response equilibrium proposed in this context by Signorino (1999, American Political Science Review 93:279-298). We then address issues of identification that arise in trying to learn about actors' utilities by observing their play of a strategic game. In general, a number of identifying restrictions are needed in order to pin down the distribution of payoffs and the effects of covariates on those payoffs.},

We suggest a class of flat-tailed priors for a general likelihood function for robust Bayesian solutions, in the same spirit as the -distribution being suggested as a flat-tail prior for normal likelihood.

However, there is no comprehensive list of problems that users experience using these systems, and no guidance for making these systems more effective. To address this, we conducted surveys and interviews with people who collect and reflect on personal information. We derived a stage-based model of personal informatics systems composed of five stages (preparation, collection, integration, reflection, and action) and identified barriers in each of the stages. These stages have four essential properties: barriers cascade to later stages; they are iterative; they are user-driven and/or system-driven; and they are uni-faceted or multi-faceted. From these properties, we recommend that personal informatics systems should 1) be designed in a holistic manner across the stages; 2) allow iteration between stages; 3) apply an appropriate balance of automated technology and user control within each stage to facilitate the user experience; and 4) explore support for associating multiple facets of peopleâs lives to enrich the value of systems.},

  Abstract                 = {Although the ``scale-free'' literature is large and growing, it gives neither a precise definition of scale-free graphs nor rigorous proofs of many of their claimed properties. In fact, it is easily shown that the existing theory has many inherent contradictions and verifiably false claims. In this paper, we propose a new, mathematically precise, and structural definition of the extent to which a graph is scale-free, and prove a series of results that recover many of the claimed properties while suggesting the potential for a rich and interesting theory. With this definition, scale-free (or its opposite, scale-rich) is closely related to other structural graph properties such as various notions of self-similarity (or respectively, self-dissimilarity). Scale-free graphs are also shown to be the likely outcome of random construction processes, consistent with the heuristic definitions implicit in existing random graph approaches. Our approach clarifies much of the confusion surrounding the sensational qualitative claims in the scale-free literature, and offers rigorous and quantitative alternatives.},

Almost all statistical studies focus on total bilateral trade, implicitly or explicitly assuming that the effect of trade on interstate conflict is constant across imports and exports in different economic sectors. In this article, we challenge this premise and provide an innovative theoretical and empirical analysis that studies the effects of exports and imports in five different sectors on the initiation of militarized interstate disputes (MID). Our theoretical model generates ex ante predictions of the effects of changes in imports and exports in the agriculture-fishery, energy, chemical-mineral, manufactured products, and miscellaneous consumption products sectors on the likelihood of MID initiation. These predictions are tested empirically in a large N sample of directed dyads from 1970 to 1997. The statistical results largely support model expectations, suggesting that scholars ought to rethink the logic of how trade affects conflict.},

  Abstract                 = {This article empirically investigates the patterns, determinants and impact of banking regulation in a large cross section of countries. Major differences of banking regulation across countries are found to be in four dimensions, i.e., the extent of government ownership of banks, the intensity of direct regulation of banks, the amount of measures to empower outside investors to monitor banks and the comprehensiveness of explicit deposit insurance. Based on these four dimensions, we identify five different patterns of banking regulation around the world. The article then tests economic, legal and cultural theories of the determinants of banking regulation, and finds dominant support for economic theory. Assessment regressions present evidence of different correlations of various banking regulation measures with banking efficiency, development and overall financial development. The findings imply a big push' view of reforming banking regulation, i.e., a big push to economic and financial sector development will lead to subsequent improvements in banking regulation, which in turn will help the country's banking and financial development.},

The model allows for bidders' individual efficiencies and opportunity costs, while permitting dependence among bidders' private values through affiliation. We establish the nonparametric identification of the APV model, characterize its theoretical restrictions, and propose a computationally convenient and consistent two-step nonparametric estimation procedure for estimating the joint private value distribution from observed bids. Using simulated bid data, we provide a step-by-step guide on how to implement our procedure and show the good behavior of our estimator in small samples.},

As the first study of the world exchange arrangements web (WEAW), we built a bipartite network with countries as one type of nodes and currencies as the other, and found it to have a prominent scale-free feature with a power-law degree distribution. In a further empirical study of the currency section of the WEAW, we calculated the clustering coefficients, average nearest-neighbors degree, and average shortest distance. As an essential economic network, the WEAW is found to be a correlated disassortative network with a hierarchical structure, possessing a more prominent scale-free feature than the world trade web (WTW).},

  Abstract                 = {We know very little about how civil wars end. Harrison Wagner has argued that negotiated settlements of civil wars are likely to break down because segments of power-sharing governments retain the capacity for resorting to civil war while victory destroys the losers' organization, making it very difficult to resume the war. An analysis of a data set of 91 post-1945 civil wars generally supports this hypothesis but only in wars over identity issues. Moreover, while military victories may be less likely to break down than negotiated settlements of identity civil wars, they are also more likely to be followed by acts of genocide. Outsiders concerned with minimizing violence thus face a dilemma.},

Formal empirical studies remain scarce, and have often focused on the question of whether democratic regimes influence trade policy, as opposed to the actual relationship between democracy and trade. This paper seeks to answer the question, ÃÆÃ¢â¬Å¡ÃâÃ¢â¬ÅDo democracies trade more?by applying the gravity equation to a large dataset of bi- lateral trade data for the period 1948-1999, while taking into account the role of democracy. It finds that democracy has a positive effect on trade flows, but only after controlling for trade pair heterogeneity. In addition, it makes the case for studies of this nature to draw a distinction between trade flows in the pre- and post-1990s period of rapid democratization as well as between developed and developing countries.},

Despite this long-standing concern with PTAs and the lack of theoretical consensus, there is no systematic evidence on whether they are actually a stumbling block to multilateral liberalization. We use detailed data on U.S. multilateral tariffs to provide the first systematic evidence that the direct effect of PTAs was to generate a stumbling block to its MTL. We also provide evidence of reciprocity in multilateral tariff reductions.},

The paper offers five keys to this free lunch puzzle. First, the costly forms of transfers usually imagined have not been practiced by real-world welfare states. Second, better tests confirm that the usually imagined costs would be felt only if policy had strayed out of sample, away from any actual historical experience. Third, the tax strategies of high-budget welfare states are more pro-growth and less progressive than has been realized. Fourth, the work disincentives of social transfers are so designed as to shield GDP from much reduction if any. Finally, we return to some positive growth and well-being benefits of the high social transfers, and suggest how democratic cost control relates to budget size.},

  Abstract                 = {In conventional crisis bargaining models, bluffing provides the primary rationale for states to misrepresent their private information, and war occurs because strong states are unable to credibly demonstrate strength to their opponents. Here, I argue that military strategy supplies an alternative reason for states to misrepresent their private information. Both strong and weak states may misrepresent themselves because of the battlefield benefits of fighting against an uninformed opponent, who may choose a suboptimal military strategy. Under appropriate conditions, the military gains for concealing information exceed the diplomatic gains available for revealing that information. Thus, states will choose to keep secrets and fight. To demonstrate this, I incorporate military strategy into the standard bargaining framework, showing that military concerns incentivize both strong and weak states to conceal information, even when they are able to reveal that information costlessly and credibly. As in the usual model, war may occur when states underestimate their adversaries, but it may also occur when states overestimate their adversaries. I further show that a mere willingness to fight does not reveal that a state is strong. I conclude the paper with two brief case studies.},

  Abstract                 = {Expert panels are playing an increasingly important role in U.S. health policy decision making. A fundamental issue in these applications is how to synthesize the judgments of individual experts into a group judgment. In this paper we propose an approach to synthesis based on Bayesian hierarchical models, and apply it to the problem of determining physician staffing at medical centers operated by the U.S. Department of Veteran Affairs (VA). Our starting point is the supra-Bayesian approach to synthesis, whose principal motivation in the present context is to generate an estimate of the uncertainty associated with a panel's evaluation of the number of physicians required under specified conditions. Hierarchical models are particularly natural in this context since variability in the experts' judgments results in part from heterogeneity in their baseline experiences at different VA medical centers. We derive alternative hierarchical Bayes synthesis distributions for the number of physicians required to handle the (service-mix specific) daily workload in internal medicine at a given VA medical center (VAMC). The analysis appears to be the first to provide a statistical treatment of expert judgment processes for evaluating the appropriate use of resources in health care. Also, while hierarchical models are well established, their application to the synthesis of expert judgment is novel.},

An efficient technique, called the monotone data augmentation algorithm, for implementing missing data imputation using the multivariate t distribution with known and unknown weights, with monotone and nonmonotone missing data, and with known and unknown degrees of freedom is presented. Two numerical examples are included to illustrate the methodology, to compare results obtained using the multivariate t distribution with results obtained using the normal distribution, and to compare the rate of convergence of the monotone data augmentation algorithm with the rate of convergence of the (rectangular) data augmentation algorithm.},

As the number of arguments increases and/or a sample size decreases, the ability of conventional means tests and regres- sion models to uncover small but real effects declines. We present a solution to this problem of the pairwise comparison of arguments: the Bradley-Terry model. Using a survey experiment conducted during a referendum on electoral reform in the province of Ontario, Canada in the fall of 2007, we show how unstructured and structured models can uncover information about the power of arguments and its sources undetected by more conventional methods. In doing so, we gain insight into the factors which drive support or opposition for electoral reform. We conclude by discussing the limits and further applications of these models.},

In a recent incident in the virtual world of online gaming, the accidental inclusion of a disease-like phenomenon provided an excellent example of the potential of such systems to alleviate these modelling constraints. We discuss this incident and how appropriate exploitation of these gaming systems could greatly advance the capabilities of applied simulation modelling in infectious disease research.},

First, political threats to the status, structure, or very existence of the central bank may force central bankers to comply with politically motivated demands on monetary policy. Second, politicians may use their powers of appointment to ensure that central bank appointees share their electoral and party-political goals. This paper derives the monetary policy outcomes obtained as a function of the degree of central bank independence (zero, partial, or full) and central bankers' types (partisans or technocrats). Based on a case study of the 1957 and 1992 institutional changes to the German central banking system and a regression analysis covering the period in between, I argue that the formal independence of the system is protected by its embeddedness in the institutions of German federalism and by the federalist components of its decentralized organizational structure. The behavioral independence of the German central bank fluctuates over time with the party control of federalist veto points. The Bundesbank is staffed with nonpartisan technocrats who are partially insulated from political pressures.},

This proposition follows from a distributive politics model in which Congress can choose to delegate trade policymaking to the President. When the congressional majority party faces a President of the other party, the former has an incentive to delegate to but to constrain the President by requiring congressional approval of trade proposals by up-or-down vote. This constraint forces the President to provide higher protection in order to assemble a congressional majority. Evidence confirms that (1) the institutional constraints placed on the President's trade policymaking authority are strengthened in times of divided government and loosened under unified government and (2) U.S. trade policy was significantly more protectionist under divided than under unified government during the period 1949-90.},

  Abstract                 = {Does the shadow of war decrease trade? I examine the influence of conflict on bilateral trade and argue that trading firms' expectations of armed conflict, both within and between nation-states, should decrease trade along with armed political violence. By assuming that firms care about future profits and assess the likelihood of a domestic or interstate conflict in the future that could disrupt trade, I argue that increasing the expectation of a domestic or interstate conflict raises the transportation, transaction, and production costs of trade. Empirically, contemporaneous trade levels should be negatively related to trading firms' beliefs about the likelihood of domestic and interstate conflicts in the future. Statistical tests, using bilateral trade data from 1984 to 1997, show that expectations of domestic or interstate conflict, in addition to violent armed conflicts, are negatively correlated with bilateral trade levels. Theoretically and empirically, this research advances our understanding of the trade-conflict relationship by demonstrating how trading firms' expectations about future conflict reduce bilateral trade levels.},

  Abstract                 = {The psychometric properties of the Depression Anxiety Stress Scales (DASS) were evaluated in a normal sample of N = 717 who were also administered the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) and the Beck Anxiety Inventory (BAI). The DASS was shown to possess satisfactory psychometric properties, and the factor structure was substantiated both by exploratory and confirmatory factor analysis. In comparison to the BDI and BAI, the DASS scales showed greater separation in factor loadings. The DASS Anxiety scale correlated 0.81 with the BAI, and the DASS Depression scale correlated 0.74 with the BDI. Factor analyses suggested that the BDI differs from the DASS Depression scale primarily in that the BDI includes items such as weight loss, insomnia, somatic preoccupation and irritability, which fail to discriminate between depression and other affective states. The factor structure of the combined BDI and BAI items was virtually identical to that reported by Beck for a sample of diagnosed depressed and anxious patients, supporting the view that these clinical states are more severe expressions of the same states that may be discerned in normals. Implications of the results for the conceptualisation of depression, anxiety and tension/stress are considered, and the utility of the DASS scales in discriminating between these constructs is discussed.},

  Abstract                 = {Lanchester equations and their extensions are widely used to calculate attrition in models of warfare. This paper examines how Lanchester models fit detailed daily data on the battles of Kursk and Ardennes. The data on Kursk, often called the greatest tank battle in history, was only recently made available. A new approach is used to find the optimal parameter values and gain an understanding of how well various parameter combinations explain the battles. It turns out that a variety of Lanchester models fit the data about as well. This explains why previous studies on Ardennes, using different minimization techniques and data formulations, have found disparate optimal fits. We also find that none of the basic Lanchester laws (i.e., square, linear, and logarithmic) fit the data particularly well or consistently perform better than the others. This means that it does not matter which of these laws you use, for with the right coefficients you will get about the same result. Furthermore, no constant attrition coefficient Lanchester law fits very well. The failure to find a good-fitting Lanchester model suggests that it may be beneficial to look for new ways to model highly aggregated attrition.},

We develop a model that relates MFN free riding to the degree of concentration of the exporters and market power of the importers of any product. Specifically, the model predicts that the level of the importerÃ¢â¬â¢s tariff resulting from negotiations should be negatively related to the product of exporter concentration, as measured by a Herfindahl-Hirschman index (sum of squared export shares), and the importerÃ¢â¬â¢s market power, as measured by the inverse elasticity of export supply, on a product-by-product basis. We test this hypothesis using data on tariffs, trade and production in 81 sectors across 35 WTO countries and find strong support.},

Most disturbingly, the scourges of piracy and terrorism are increasingly intertwined: piracy on the high seas is becoming a key tactic of terrorist groups. Many of today's pirates are maritime terrorists with an ideological bent and a broad political agenda. This nexus of piracy and terrorism is especially dangerous for energy markets: most of the world's oil and gas is shipped through the world's most piracy-infested waters. Despite problems of state sovereignty and overlapping jurisdiction, several steps can be taken to help protect maritime trade and energy markets, as well as to help nations begin to break the forming nexus between piracy and terrorism. At a time when the US Congress has decided to enable airline pilots to carry weapons, it is worth examining a similar policy for officers on civilian ships.},

  Abstract                 = {This article uses the Bayesian approach to estimate the parameters of the normalized constant elasticity of substitution (CES) function with factor-augmenting technical progress directly, rather than using derived first-order conditions of profit maximizing behavior. Bayesian estimation is applied because maximum likelihood estimation is sensitive to the starting values of maximization, and the parameters typically fail to converge to the global optimum because of a multimodal likelihood. Thanks to a convenient prior distribution, the posterior simulation of parameters works fairly well. The results indicate that in the long run (over 100 years) the parameters for the elasticity of substitution and capital income share are intimately linked to the shape of capital-augmenting technological progress. In particular, the linear restriction excludes the possibility that the speed of capital-augmenting technological progress converges to zero, which seems to lead to upwardly biased estimate},

We also identify brokers who act as links between subcommunities and who appear to be crucial to the social cohesion of the population as a whole. The network is found to be similar to human social networks in some respects but different in some others such as the level of assortative mixing by degree within the population. This difference elucidates some of the means by which the network formed and evolves.},

  Abstract                 = {Human rights practices have improved significantly throughout Latin America during the 1990s, but different degrees of legalization are not the main explanation for these changes. We examine state compliance with three primary norms of international human rights law: the prohibition against torture, the prohibition against disappearance, and the right to democratic governance. Although these norms vary in their degree of obligation, precision, and delegation, states have improved their practices in all three issue-areas. The least amount of change has occurred in the most highly legalized issue-area-the prohibition against torture. We argue that a broad regional norm shift-a "norms cascade"-has led to increased regional and international consensus with respect to an interconnected bundle of human rights norms, including the three discussed in this article. These norms are reinforced by diverse legal and political enforcement mechanisms that help to implement and ensure compliance with them.},

  Abstract                 = {Why do states delegate certain tasks and responsibilities to international organizations rather than acting unilaterally or cooperating directly? Furthermore, to what extent do states continue to control IOs once authority has been delegated? Examining a variety of different institutions including the World Trade Organization, the United Nations and the European Commission, this book explores the different methods that states employ to ensure their interests are being served, and identifies the problems involved with monitoring and managing IOs. The contributors suggest that it is not inherently more difficult to design effective delegation mechanisms at international level than at domestic level and, drawing on principal-agent theory, help explain the variations that exist in the extent to which states are willing to delegate to IOs. They argue that IOs are neither all evil nor all virtuous, but are better understood as bureaucracies that can be controlled to varying degrees by their political masters. },

The score vector and log-likelihood are computed in the same pass. The new algorithm is derived from the forward-backward algorithm traditionally used to evaluate the likelihood in hidden Markov models. Our result is discussed in the context of previous approaches that have been used to obtain approximate standard errors of parameter estimates in these models. Implications for parameter estimation are also discussed. An application of the proposed methods to rainfall occurrence data is provided.},

  Abstract                 = {The Vietnam and Algerian wars have demonstrated that the overwhelming conventional military superiority of major powers is no guarantee against their defeat in wars against small nations. For external powers such wars are necessarily "limited," which constrains escalation above certain levels. With no direct survival interest at stake, fighting the war does not take automatic priority over the pursuit of other social, political, and economic objectives. Prosecuting the war consumes resources--economic, human, and political--which are thus not available for the pursuit of these other objectives. In the absence of a quick victory this creates the potential for those political divisions which historically have shifted the balance of forces in the metropolis in favor of withdrawal. For the insurgents, the fact of invasion and occupation generates cohesion, minimizes constraints on mobilization, and maximizes the willingness to incur costs. Precisely the opposite effects tend to characterize the war effort of the external power. A conceptual framework for the analysis of the evolution and outcome of such conflicts is presented and its applications and limitations discussed.},

  Abstract                 = {Realistic estimates of mode 4 trade are virtually non-existent. Based on the GATS legal definition, the paper introduces the statistical conceptualization of mode 4. While showing that balance of payments labour related flows indicators, such as worker's remittances and compensation of employees, cannot be used as substitutes, the paper discusses relevant balance of payments transactions in individual services sectors for estimating the value of this trade. Given the complexity of many services contracts (one service contract may involve the use of more than one mode to supply services to consumers), it provides simplifying assumptions that help build these measures of mode 4 trade in services. The paper recognizes that the proposed simplified statistical approach to modes of supply does not strictly adhere to GATS provisions and explains that it has been designed as a first guidance to provide relevant information for GATS while ensuring feasibility and consistency with statistical frameworks. Examples are given, showing the interest of some economies to estimate the size of mode 4 trade. The paper also presents how existing migration and tourism statistics could be used to assess the physical mode 4 movement (flows) and presence (stocks) in terms of number of persons. It introduces necessary extensions (separate identification of relevant mode 4 categories of persons, breakdowns by origin/destination, occupations, length of stay etc.) of these statistical frameworks in order to conduct a proper assessment of mode 4.},

The model also provides a new rationale for the use of tariff ceilings.

Thus, recently there has been tremendous interest in generating realistic network topologies. Such work must begin with an understanding of existing network topologies, which today typically consists of a relatively small number of data sources. In this paper, we calculate an extensive set of important characteristics of Internet AS-level topologies extracted from the three data sources most frequently used by the research community: traceroutes, BGP, and WHOIS. We find that traceroute and BGP topologies are similar to one another but differ substantially from the WHOIS topology. We discuss the interplay between the properties of the data sources that result from specific data collection mechanisms and the resulting topology views. We find that, among metrics widely considered, the joint degree distribution appears to fundamentally characterize Internet AS-topologies: it narrowly defines values for other important metrics. We also introduce an evaluation criteria for the accuracy oftopology generators and verify previous observations that generators solely reproducing degree distributions cannot capture the full spectrum of critical topological characteristics of any of the three topologies. Finally, we release to the community the input topology datasets, along with the scripts and output of our calculations. This supplement should enable researchers to validate their models against real data and to make more informed selection of topology data sources for their specific needs},

  Abstract                 = {Prediction markets, in which contract prices are used to forecast future events, are increasingly applied to various domains ranging from political contests to scientific breakthroughs. However, the dynamics of such markets are not well understood. Here, we study the return dynamics of the oldest, most data-rich prediction markets, the Iowa Electronic Presidential Election âwinner-takes-allâ markets. As with other financial markets, we find uncorrelated returns, power-law decaying volatility correlations, and, usually, power-law decaying distributions of returns. However, unlike other financial markets, we find conditional diverging volatilities as the contract settlement date approaches. We propose a dynamic binary option model that captures all features of the empirical data and can potentially provide a tool with which one may extract true information events from a price time series.},

  Abstract                 = {A large consensus now seems to take for granted that the distributions of empirical returns of financial time series are regularly varying, with a tail exponent close to 3. We revisit this results and use standard tests as well as develop a battery of new non-parametric and parametric tests (in particular with stretched exponential (SE) distributions) to characterize the distributions of empirical returns of financial time series, with application to the 100 years of daily return of the Dow Jones Industrial Average and over 1 years of 5-minutes returns of the Nasdaq Composite index. Based on the discovery that the SE distribution tends to the Pareto distribution in a certain limit such that the Pareto (or power law) distribution can be approximated with any desired accuracy on an arbitrary interval by a suitable adjustment of the parameters of the SE distribution, we demonstrate that Wilks' test of nested hypothesis still works for the non-exactly nested comparison between the SE and Pareto distributions. The SE distribution is found significantly better over the whole quantile range but becomes unnecessary beyond the 95\% quantiles compared with the Pareto law. Similar conclusions hold for the log-Weibull model with respect to the Pareto distribution. Our main result is that the tails ultimately decay slower than any stretched exponential distribution but probably faster than power laws with reasonable exponents. Implications of our results on the ``moment condition failure'' and for risk estimation and management are presented.},

  Abstract                 = {Preferential trade agreements have proliferated rapidly within the last 15 years, growing into a dense network of multiple ties between countries. The spread of PTAs, however, is not uniform: some countries have signed a multitude of deals, while oth- ers remain much less involved. Certain countries manage to position themselves as hubs with ties spanning the globe, yet others are at most connected to their immediate neighbours. This paper presents a longitudinal network analysis method to analyze the patterns of the formation of trade agreements, based on the mutual co-determination of network structure and actor choices. The findings suggest that preferential trade agreements establish a clear hierarchy among countries: Developed countries avoid agreements with each other, form ties with middle-income countries, but shun the least developed members of the system. Middle-income countries establish a horizontal level of PTAs in the system that is characterized by regionally concentrated subnetworks. Supplanting the multilateral trade regime with preferential agreements therefore cre- ates a system of highly asymmetrical relationships of weaker spokes around a few hubs, while potentially leaving the weakest members behind.},

Although this tradeoff remains a necessary building block of business cycle theory, economists have yet to provide a completely satisfactory explanation for it. According to the consensus view among central bankers and monetary economists, a contractionary monetary shock raises unemployment, at least temporarily, and leads to a delayed and gradual fall in inflation. Standard dynamic models of price adjustment, however, cannot explain this pattern of responses. Reconciling the consensus view about the effects of monetary policy with models of price adjustment remains an outstanding puzzle for business cycle theorists.},

  Abstract                 = {This article examines some international factors contributing to the recent spread of preferential trading arrangements (PTAs). PTAs help states to ensure against future disruptions of commerce with key trade partners. When stress is placed on the international trading system, the threat of such disruptions rises. Both hegemonic decline and global recessions raise the specter of commercial closure, and therefore each factor may stimulate the proliferation of PTAs. Furthermore, strategic interaction among both PTAs and countries is likely to guide the growth of preferential arrangements. As PTAs become increasingly pervasive, states that are not covered by one have strong incentives to enter such an arrangement. Doing so reduces the prospect that their access to important markets will be curtailed and that their competitiveness abroad will be undermined. The findings of this article conform with these arguments. In general, eroding hegemony, global recessions, and strategic interdependence have accelerated the pace of commercial regionalism since World War II.},

We argue that these analyses provide key insights into the political underpinnings of regionalism. They also indicate that studies neglecting political conditions risk arriving at misleading conclusions about regionalism's causes and consequences. At the same time, however, recent research leaves various key theoretical and empirical issues unresolved, including which political factors bear most heavily on regionalism and the nature of their effects.},

  Abstract                 = {Over the past fifty years, barriers to international trade have decreased substantially. A key source of this decline in protectionism has been the proliferation of agreements among countries to liberalize commerce. In this article, we analyze the domestic political conditions under which states have concluded such agreements and, more generally, explore the factors affecting interstate economic cooperation. We argue that interstate cooperation on commercial issues depends heavily on the political regime types of participants: as states become more democratic, they are increasingly likely to conclude trade agreements. To test our claim, we examine whether the regime types of states have influenced their propensity to form and expand preferential trading arrangements (PTAs) during the period since World War II. We find that democratic countries are about twice as likely to form a PTA as autocratic countries, and that pairs of democracies are roughly four times as likely to do so as autocratic pairs. These results provide strong evidence that democracies are more commercially cooperative than less democratic countries.},

  Abstract                 = {Relatively little research has focused on whether countries' political institutions affect their international trade relations. We address this issue by analyzing the relationship between regime type and trade policy. In a formal model of commercial policy, we establish that the ratification responsibility of the legislature in democratic states leads pairs of democracies to set trade barriers at a lower level than mixed country-pairs (composed of an autocracy and a democracy). We test this hypothesis by analyzing the effects of regime type on trade during the period from 1960 to 1990. The results of this analysis accord with our argument: Democratic pairs have had much more open trade relations than mixed pairs.},

Xinyuan Dai (2002) incorrectly asserts that our conclusion depends on the preferences of the decision makers who formulate trade policy. We show that Dai fails to accurately replicate our model, and hence erroneously claims that the new equilibria she deduces are consistent with it. In addition, we demonstrate that in altering one of our assumptions, Dai offers a model that is less realistic as well as inconsistent with the substantive literature on international bargaining. Finally, we question the robustness of her approach. Due to these problems of replication, realism, and robustness, we conclude that Dai\&apos;s model is of limited utility.},

  Abstract                 = { ABSTRACT During the past half-century, states have established a large number of international trade institutions, both multilateral and regional in scope. The existing literature on this topic emphasizes that these agreements are chiefly designed to liberalize and increase the flow of overseas commerce. Yet such institutions have another function that has been largely ignored by researchers, namely, reducing volatility in trade policy and trade flows. Exposure to global markets increases the vulnerability of a country's output to terms of trade shocks. Governments seek to insulate their economies from such instability through membership in international trade institutions, particularly the World Trade Organization (WTO) and preferential trading arrangements (PTAs). We hypothesize that these institutions reduce the volatility of overseas commerce. We further hypothesize that, because market actors prefer price stability, trade institutions increase the volume of foreign commerce by reducing trade variability. This article conducts the first large-scale, multivariate statistical tests of these two hypotheses, using annual data on exports for all pairs of countries from 1951 through 2001. The tests provide strong support for our arguments. PTAs and the WTO regime significantly reduce export volatility. In so doing, these institutions also increase export levels. },

During the same era, multilateral openness has grown to unprecedented heights, spurred by the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) and its successor, the World Trade Organization (WTO). If the cornerstone of the manifestly successful multilateral regime is nondiscrimination, why have its members increasingly resorted to preferential liberalization? We argue that developments at the heart of GATT/WTO encourage its members to form PTAs as devices to obtain bargaining leverage within the multilateral regime. Specifically, the growth in GATT/WTO membership, the periodic multilateral trade negotiation rounds, as well as participation and, especially, losses in formal GATT/WTO disputes, have led its members to seek entrance into PTAs. Conducting the first statistical tests on the subject, we find strong evidence in support of this argument.},

It argues that both polarization and interdependence must be conceptualized in terms of different types of relations among states and that different relationships would reflect varied levels of polarization and inter-dependence. Accordingly, this study develops general measures of network polarization and interdependence that allow measurement of these concepts over a wide array of international relations. Hypotheses are deduced from the realist and liberal paradigms about how alliance polarization, trade polarization, and cultural polarization affect systemic conflict. Likewise, hypotheses are deduced regarding the expected effects of strategic and economic interdependence on conflict. These hypotheses are tested using data on alliance, trade, linguistic, and religious networks over the period 1816-2002. The findings suggest that alliance polarization and strategic interdependence increase the amount of systemic conflict, while trade polarization and economic interdependence have a dampening effect on the amount of conflict in the international system. The theoretical implications of these results are discussed.},

This study examines how different types of affinity affect the likelihood of conflict between states. The authors discuss different types of affinities as these appear in the realist and liberal paradigms. They offer a social networks conception of structural affinity--the concept of structural equivalence--which reflects the similarity of international ties across a set of different networks. They test the hypotheses derived from these paradigms, using both existing measures of affinity and their own structural equivalence measures. Their findings suggest that (1) strategic affinity has a consistent dampening effect on the probability of dyadic conflict, (2) trade-related affinity does consistently affect the probability of dyadic conflict, and (3) intergovernmental organization-related affinity has a negative impact on conflict, mostly in the twentieth century.},

  Abstract                 = {This review essay examines a number of areas in the study of war management. First, current work on war bargaining combines previous models of prewar bargaining with intra-war bargaining. These models attempt to depict both the elements of intra-war bat-gaining and its possible outcome within a dynamic setting in which battles as well as diplomacy provide combatants with information about the possible military outcome of the war. Second, studies of the domestic politics of war management focused primarily on the interrelations between war progress, casualties, and public opinion. As such these studies are strongly biased towards democratic politics of war management. We know very little about the domestic process of war management in non-democratic states. Nor is there much systematic empirical work on civil-military relations during wartime. Third, war expansion models have expanded our knowledge on the factors that increase the probability of third party intervention, as well as on the domestic and international factors that prohibit intervention. Fourth, the literature on the relationship between war management and war outcomes focused on selection models and performance models that attempt to account for the disproportionate tendency of democracies to win the war they fight. Finally, mediation studies have expanded our knowledge of the conditions under which third parties are likely to enter the war as peaceful mediators, the strategies of mediation they select, and the effect of these factors on the outcome of the mediation process. We evaluate the strengths and weaknesses of these literatures and identify several important lacunae that may stimulate future research oil war management.},

  Abstract                 = { ABSTRACT This study explores logical and empirical implications of friendship and enmity in world politics by linking indirect international relations (e.g., ) to direct relations ( ). The realist paradigm suggests that states ally against common enemies and thus states sharing common enemies should not fight each other. Nor are states expected to ally with enemies of their allies or with allies of their enemies. Employing social network methodology to measure direct and indirect relations, we find that international interactions over the last 186 years exhibit significant relational imbalances: states that share the same enemies and allies are disproportionately likely to be both allies and enemies at the same time. Our explanation of the causes and consequences of relational imbalances for international conflict/cooperation combines ideas from the realist and the liberal paradigms. factors such as the presence of strategic rivalry, opportunism and exploitative tendencies, capability parity, and contiguity increase the likelihood of relational imbalances. On the other hand, factors consistent with the liberal paradigm (e.g., joint democracy, economic interdependence, shared IGO membership) tend to reduce relational imbalances. Finally, we find that the likelihood of conflict increases with the presence of relational imbalances. We explore the theoretical and practical implications of these issues. },

  Abstract                 = {At the heart of attitudinal and strategic explanations of judicial behavior is the assumption that justices have policy preferences. In this paper we employ Markov chain Monte Carlo methods to fit a Bayesian measurement model of ideal points for all justices serving on the U.S. Supreme Court from 1953 through 1999. We are particularly interested in determining to what extent ideal points of justices change throughout their tenure on the Court. This is important because judicial politics scholars oftentimes invoke preference measures that are time invariant. To investigate preference change, we posit a dynamic item response model that allows ideal points to change systematically over time. Additionally, we introduce Bayesian methods for fitting multivariate dynamic linear models to political scientists. Our results suggest that many justices do not have temporally constant ideal points. Moreover, our ideal point estimates outperform existing measures and explain judicial behavior quite well across civil rights, civil liberties, economics, and federalism cases.},

  Abstract                 = {Why do states delegate certain tasks and responsibilities to international organizations rather than acting unilaterally or cooperating directly? Furthermore, to what extent do states continue to control IOs once authority has been delegated? Examining a variety of different institutions including the World Trade Organization, the United Nations and the European Commission, this book explores the different methods that states employ to ensure their interests are being served, and identifies the problems involved with monitoring and managing IOs. The contributors suggest that it is not inherently more difficult to design effective delegation mechanisms at international level than at domestic level and, drawing on principal-agent theory, help explain the variations that exist in the extent to which states are willing to delegate to IOs. They argue that IOs are neither all evil nor all virtuous, but are better understood as bureaucracies that can be controlled to varying degrees by their political masters.},

  Abstract                 = {The conditions under which states will cooperate to impose economic sanctions are of both theoretical and practical interest. Generally, when sanctions are used, one state takes the lead in organizing and imposing them. Other states have incentives to free ride on the "leading sender's" efforts. To gain cooperation, the leading sender uses tactical issue-linkage in the form of either threats or side payments. The success of cooperation depends on the credibility of these issue-linkages. The use of high-cost sanctions and international institutions raises the potential for high audience costs if the leading sender reneges. These policies thus indicate credible commitments. Data on ninety-nine cases of post-1945 economic sanctions show that costly measures coincide with high levels of international cooperation.},

To analyze this process, Lisa Martin uses a novel methodology combining game-theoretic models, statistical analysis, and case studies. She emphasizes that credible commitments gain international cooperation, and concludes that the involvement of international institutions and the willingness of the main "sender" to bear heavy costs are the central factors influencing the sanction's credibility.},

Their Wordscores approach, by automating text-coding procedures, represents an advance in content analysis that will potentially have a large long-term impact on research across the discipline. To allow substantive interpretation, the scores produced by the Wordscores procedure require transformation. In this note, we address several shortcomings in the transformation procedure introduced in the original program. We demonstrate that the original transformation distorts the metric on which content scores are placed--hindering the ability of scholars to make meaningful comparisons across texts--and that it is very sensitive to the texts that are scored--opening up the possibility that researchers may generate, inadvertently or not, results that depend on the texts they choose to include in their analyses. We propose a transformation procedure that solves these problems.},

When war can occur because of the presence of asymmetric information, the probability of escalation is lower for countries that trade more bilaterally because of the opportunity cost associated with the loss of trade gains. However, countries more open to global trade have a higher probability of war because multilateral trade openness decreases bilateral dependence to any given country and the cost of a bilateral conflict. We test our predictions on a large data set of military conflicts on the 1950â2000 period. Using different strategies to solve the endogeneity issues, including instrumental variables, we find robust evidence for the contrasting effects of bilateral and multilateral trade openness. For proximate countries, we find that trade has had a surprisingly large effect on their probability of military conflict.},

  Abstract                 = {This paper analyzes theoretically and empirically the relationship between trade and war. We show that the intuition that trade promotes peace is only partially true even in a model where trade is beneficial to all, war reduces trade and leaders take into account the costs of war. When war can occur because of the presence of asymmetric information, the probability of escalation is indeed lower for countries that trade more bilaterally because of the opportunity cost associated with the loss of trade gains. However, countries more open to global trade have a higher probability of war because multilateral trade openness decreases bilateral dependence to any given country. Using a theoretically-based econometric model, we test our predictions on a large dataset of military conflicts in the period 1948-2001. We find strong evidence for the contrasting effects of bilateral and multilateral trade. Our empirical results also confirm our theoretical prediction that multilateral trade openness increases more the probability of war between proximate countries. This may explain why military conflicts have become more localized and less global over time.},

  Abstract                 = {Studies comparing the ideological leanings of voters and elected officials are often hampered by the lack of a common measure. We use legislative referenda â on which state legislators and voters both vote on the same issue â as bridging observations to develop a common measure for both. Examining referenda vote during several sessions of the California Assembly, we find that legislators are significantly more ideologically extreme than the median voter in their districts. We additionally find that members of the majority party are considerably more extreme relative to their districts than members of the minority party are, and that the majority party becomes even more extreme the longer it maintains control of the chamber.},

  Abstract                 = {In 1994 a young journalist with a sharp eye for social anxieties and a flair for dramatic prose wrote an article that described environmental change as "the national security issue of the early 21st century." Robert Kaplan's thesis in "The Coming Anarchy" is fetchingly simple: combine weak political systems, burgeoning urban populations, grinding poverty, and a flood of cheap weapons, and society becomes highly volatile. This lethal mixture, Kaplan suggests, already is generating high levels of violence in West Africa; soon it will affect the rest of the planet. This will happen because at the root of social collapse in West Africa is environmental degradation -- a problem the entire world is experiencing. The pathways to chaos may differ from one place to the next, but all of humankind is being pushed along them. The state of the environment, Kaplan concludes, has become a matter of national security. In Washington and elsewhere, security specialists proved receptive to the thrust of Kaplan's argument. As an expression of threat and vulnerability, the Cold War had lost much, if not all, of its real world resonance by the mid-1990s.

Afurther reason for the oversight is that arbitration is resolutelyprivate, making information exceedingly dif cult to obtain. Twodistinguished international arbitrators, Alan Redfern and Martin Hunter,recently observed that the study of the practice of internationalcommercial arbitration is like peering into the dark. Few arbitralawards are published and even fewer procedural decisions of arbitraltribunals come to light.

We find that pro-trade preferences are significantly and robustly correlated with an individual's level of human capital, in the manner predicted by the factor endowments model. Preferences over trade are also correlated with the trade exposure of the sector in which an individual is employed: individuals in non-traded sectors tend to be the most pro-trade, while individuals in sectors with a revealed comparative disadvantage are the most protectionist. Third, an individual's relative economic status has a very strong positive association with pro-trade attitudes. Finally, non-economic determinants, in the form of values, identities, and attachments, play an important role in explaining the variation in preferences over trade. High degrees of neighborhood attachment and nationalism/patriotism are associated with protectionist tendencies.},

Both hypotheses were supported for first-time presidential election victories since 1789 and all elections of the past 100 years. In addition, the first hypothesis was supported for all elections since 1789, with 1812 and 1832 excluded; the second hypothesis was supported for all elections since 1789, with 1812, 1832, 1844, 1852, and 1864 excluded.

We assess whether there is a strong causal relationship between congressional districting and polarization. We find very little evidence for such a link. First, we show that congressional polarization is primarily a function of the differences in how Democrats and Republicans represent the same districts rather than a function of which districts each party represents or the distribution of constituency preferences. Second, we conduct simulations to gauge the level of polarization under various Ã¢â¬ÅneutralÃ¢â¬ï¿½ districting procedures. We find that the actual levels of polarization are not much higher than those produced by the simulations. We do find that gerrymandering has increased the Republican seat share in the House; however, this increase is not an important source of polarization.},

  Abstract                 = {Simulation smoothing involves drawing state variables (or innovations) in discrete time stateâspace models from their conditional distribution given parameters and observations. Gaussian simulation smoothing is of particular interest, not only for the direct analysis of Gaussian linear models, but also for the indirect analysis of more general models. Several methods for Gaussian simulation smoothing exist, most of which are based on the Kalman filter. Since states in Gaussian linear stateâspace models are Gaussian Markov random fields, it is also possible to apply the Cholesky Factor Algorithm (CFA) to draw states. This algorithm takes advantage of the band diagonal structure of the Hessian matrix of the log density to make efficient draws. We show how to exploit the special structure of stateâspace models to draw latent states even more efficiently. We analyse the computational efficiency of Kalman-filter-based methods, the CFA, and our new method using counts of operations and computational experiments. We show that for many important cases, our method is most efficient. Gains are particularly large for cases where the dimension of observed variables is large or where one makes repeated draws of states for the same parameter values. We apply our method to a multivariate Poisson model with time-varying intensities, which we use to analyse financial market transaction count data. },

  Abstract                 = {After William Gosset (1876-1937), the "Student" of Student's t, the best statisticians have distinguished economic (or agronomic or psychological or medical) significance from merely statistical "significance" at conventional levels. A singular exception among the best was Ronald A. Fisher, who argued in the 1920s that statistical significance at the .05 level is a necessary and sufficient condition for establishing a scientific result. After Fisher many economists and some others Ãâ but rarely physicists, chemists, and geologists, who seldom use Fisher-significance Ãâ have mixed up the two kinds of significance. We have been writing on the matter for some decades, with other critics in medicine, sociology, psychology, and the like. Hoover and Siegler, despite a disdainful rhetoric, agree with the logic of our case. Fisherian "significance," they agree, is neither necessary nor sufficient for scientific significance. But they claim that economists already know this and that Fisherian tests can still be used for specification searches. Neither claim seems to be true. Our massive evidence that economists get it wrong appears to hold up. And if rhetorical standards are needed to decide the importance of a coefficient in the scientific conversation, so are they needed when searching for an equation to fit. Fisherian "significance" signifies nearly nothing, and empirical economics as actually practiced is in crisis.},

Our results show that greater network connectivity helps to facilitate coordination both in symmetric and asymmetric games. Most significantly, we find that network connectivity facilitates coordination even when payoffs are highly asymmetric.

The basic computational tool we use in the proposed analysis is the Gibbs sampler. For illustration, we apply the analysis to several examples.},

On the issue of cross-national comparability, we find cross-national variation in expert surveys is muted. They contain little more than the variation associated with reputations based on party-family affiliation. The CMP measurements, on the other hand, contain variation attributable to national party-system differences. We conclude with thoughts about why all of this is so and about how one might navigate the expert survey limitations depending on the question one wants to answer about democratic politics and policy making.

We construct a more accurate estimate of those eligible to vote, from 1948-2000, using government statistical series to adjust for ineligible but included groups, such as noncitizens and felons, and eligible but excluded groups, such as overseas citizens. We show that the ineligible population, not the nonvoting, has been increasing since 1972. During the 1960s the turnout rate trended downward both nationally and outside the South. Although the average turnout rates for presidential and congressional elections are lower since 1972 than during 1948-70, the only pattern since 1972 is an increased turnout rate in southern congressional elections. While the voting age was lowered to 18 in 1971, the lower turnout rate of young voters accounts for less than one-fourth of reduced voter participation.},

It considers how party discipline affects which industries receive tariff protection from foreign imports. I develop a theoretical framework and generate a set of testable predictions. Highly disciplined parties in majoritarian systems offer trade policies favorable to voters in marginal districts. At the margin, electorally consolidated industries located in marginal districts will be highly protected. However, in majoritarian systems with low party discipline, the model predicts tariff protection will favor large, electorally dispersed industries. Industries concentrated in marginal districts are expected to be the least favorably protected. Regression analysis is used on data from the 1970s on industry tariffs levels and industry employment levels across electoral districts in the United States and Canada. The findings generally support the theoretical model. In Canada, industries highly concentrated in marginal districts receive the most favorable levels of protection. In the United States, industries located in safe districts receive more favorable levels of protection than industries located in marginal districts. Although electorally concentrated industries receive higher levels of protection, on average, than electorally decentralized industries; in the United States large, electorally dispersed industries are able to secure favorable levels of protection.},

If nations utilize leader specific punishment, that is target policies against leaders rather than the nations they represent, then leaders improve the credibly of their threats to punish noncompliance since citizens have incentives to depose leaders to restore national integrity. },

  Abstract                 = {We investigate the use of standard statistical models for quantal choice in a game theoretic setting. Players choose strategies based on relative expected utility and assume other players do so as well. We define a quantal response equilibrium (ORE) as a fixed point of this process and establish existence. For a logit specification of the error structure, we show that as the error goes to zero, QRE approaches a subset of Nash equilibria and also implies a unique selection from the set of Nash equilibria in generic games. We fit the model to a variety of experimental data sets by using maximum likelihood estimation. Journal of Economic Literature Classification Numbers: C19, C44, C72, C92.},

  Abstract                 = {The Kyoto Protocol is an ideal test case for theories of two-level bargaining, because countries received unique quotas (verifiable quantitative bargaining outcomes) and the treaty was subject to legislative ratification. Indeed, prominent countries, including the United States and Russia, used the threat of withholding ratification strategically during bargaining. However, our quantitative analysis yields the surprising finding that ratification constraints did not appreciably affect the outcomes of the Kyoto bargaining, nor did bargaining outcomes affect ratification. Domestic political constraints did affect ratification, but not bargaining. Instead of casting the Kyoto Protocol in the two-level bargaining framework, we find that the politics of the Kyoto Protocol are best understood as a matter of hegemonic leadership by the European Union, which offered selective incentivesÃÆÃ¢â¬Å¡ÃâÃ¢â¬âEU accession in most cases, but WTO accession in the case of RussiaÃÆÃ¢â¬Å¡ÃâÃ¢â¬âto countries that participated. This interpretation of the data is confirmed by case studies of Russia and Poland.},

The dichotomy between oneÃ¢â¬â¢ own and othersÃ¢â¬â¢ information quality can explain the others wise puzzling empirical relationship between education and turnout, and suggests the importance of relative information variables in explaining turnout, which I verify empirically for U.S. primary and general elections.

  Abstract                 = {The Exponential Stochastic Lanchester (ESL) model of attrition is well known and can be found in many combat models. This paper is concerned with exploring the effects of applying the ESL attrition model to battles which have been split into different arrangements of smaller engagements or fire fights. These fire fights were mainly resolved using a Markov chain formulation of the ESL model. Some interesting and non-intuitive trends were uncovered. It is shown that the ESL model predicts an increasing advantage for the defending side as a battle is split into a larger number of smaller parallel engagements.},

Finally, these data weaken somewhat, but do not overturn Churchill's argument that, in every battle period on the Western Front, Allied casualties were greater than German casualties}

The data show that Chairman Alan Greenspan's proposals, after Committee discussion, were nearly always adopted unmodified in the formal vote. Despite the external appearance of consensus with little disagreement over decisions and an official dissent rate of 7.5 percent, the data reveal that the rate of disagreement in internal Committee discussions was quite high-on the order of 30 percent for discussions of the short-term interest rate. And, under the assumption that FOMC voters assigned a higher priority to their preferences for the short-term interest rate than for the bias in the policy directive, it can be shown that this bias was important for achieving consensus, which supports and extends the results of Thornton and Wheelock (2000). Thus, the novel dataset described in this paper helps to shed some light on the internal workings of the FOMC in the Greenspan years.},

  Abstract                 = {Voters have been coordinating their choices for president and House of Representatives in recent presidential election years, with each voter using a strategy that features policy moderation. Coordination is defined as a noncooperative rational expectations equilibrium among voters, in which each voter has both common knowledge and private information about the election outcome. Stochastic choice models estimated using individual-level NES data from 1976-96 support coordination versus a model in which voters act nonstrategically to moderate policy. The empirical coordinating model satisfies the fixed-point condition that defines the common knowledge expectation voters have about the outcome in the theoretical equilibrium. The proportion of voters who split their ticket in order to balance the House with the president has been small but large enough to affect election outcomes. Moderation has usually been based on voters' expectations that the president will be at least an equal of the House in determining postelection policy.},

  Abstract                 = {This paper investigates the effects of preferential trade agreements (PTAs) on bilateral trade flows using a comprehensive database of PTAs in force and a detailed matrix of world trade. We show that total trade between PTA partners is a poor proxy for preferential trade (trade in tariff lines where preferences are likely to matter): while the former amounted to one-third of global trade in 2000ÃÆÃ¢â¬Å¡ÃâÃ¢â¬â02, the latter was between one-sixth and one-tenth of world trade. Our gravity model estimates indicate that using total rather than preferential trade to assess the impacts of PTAs leads to a significant downward bias in the PTA coefficient. We find that product exclusions and long phase-in periods significantly limit preferential trade, and their removal could more than double trade in tariff lines above 3 percent most favored nation (MFN) duties. We also show that the effects of PTAs on trade vary by type of agreement and are increasing in the incomes of PTA partners.},

  Abstract                 = {In a general equilibrium model of a labor economy, the size of government, measured by the share of income redistributed, is determined by majority rule. Voters rationally anticipate the disincentive effects of taxation on the labor-leisure choices of their fellow citizens and take the effect into account when voting. The share of earned income redistributed depends on the voting rule and on the distribution of productivity in the economy. Under majority rule, the equilibrium tax share balances the budget and pays for the voters' choices. The principal reasons for increased size of government implied by the model are extensions of the franchise that change the position of the decisive voter in the income distribution and changes in relative productivity. An increase in mean income relative to the income of the decisive voter increases the size of government.},

  Abstract                 = {Decapitation operation has existed for a long time in military history; however, it was not until March 2003 'decapitation attack' became a well known term in the mass media. This paper is based on the connotation of decapitation based on historical study and refines the term into military strategic concept of decapitation strategy. Ideas derived from detailed studies on Lanchester-type combat models are used to describe the effectiveness of conventional regular forces under decapitation warfare, which includes asymmetric, nonlinear, stand-off and special operation forces (SOF) operations. A conceptual model is presented to describe the effects of the decapitation strategy on the regular battlefield. With extensive coverage of operational factors such as robustness of forces, time difference between combats, undermining effects, breakpoints, attrition rates, total force level and force allocation, the model is suitable to analyse complex scenario with different types of military operations consisting of decapitation strategy. An illustrative example is provided to demonstrate the application of the model. The conceptual model is built based on hypotheses, assumptions, and criteria. In the absence of historical data, no data analysis and parameter estimation are involved.},

  Abstract                 = { ABSTRACT Recent events have raised questions about the extent to which military intervention promotes democracy and the degree to which this depends on the nature of the intervener. We argue that traction on these issues is best obtained by focusing on the policies of the target state that have the greatest implications for the political survival of the intervening state&apos;s leader and the kind of governmental institutions in the target state that are most likely to produce them. This perspective generally&mdash;although not always&mdash;predicts that third-party military intervention in civil wars, other intra- or interstate disputes and wars will lead to little if any improvement, and all too often erosion in the trajectory of democratic development. Three hypotheses on the impact of third-party intervention by democracies, autocracies, and the United Nations are then tested and strongly supported against a counterfactual expectation of what the democratic trajectory would have been in the absence of intervention.We benefited greatly from the wise counsel of Feryal Cherif, Michael Gilligan, Shanker Satyanath, and Alastair Smith, each of whom read or discussed in depth earlier versions of this study. Patrick Regan was also extremely helpful in providing data and guidance in the use of the data on interventions that he has made available. The study was significantly improved by the insightful advice of the anonymous reviewers (we wish we could thank them by name) and by Lisa Martin&apos;s able and thoughtful guidance. Authors often complain about referees; we have nothing but praise for the contributions they made. Of course, we alone are responsible for any errors and for all remaining shortcomings in this investigation. },

Players are uncertain about their own payoffs from war because of differences between observable and actual capabilities. We derive four hypotheses, testing them against crises in Europe between 1815 and 1970. We show a nonmonotonic relationship between ex ante observable capabilities and the likelihood of violence in a crisis, as well as the ex ante likelihood of a negotiated settlement. We answer five questions: (1) How do differences in observable capabilities between rivals influence the likelihood of a crisis and the escalation to violence? (2) How do intangible capabilities alter the effects of observable capabilities on the likelihood of conflict and violence? (3) What do national leaders learn from the responses of their adversaries in crises? (4) Under what conditions can deterrence succeed? (5) Under what conditions are the strong likely to give in to the weak or vice versa in a crisis?},

The factors considered include the state of the economy, the viability of institutions for the nonviolent expression of grievance, the ability of the factional leaders to provide nonideological benefits, and the risks associated with splintering. The model highlights that, for strategic reasons, changes in the structural environment often entail trade-offs between decreasing terrorist mobilization and increasing extremism. For instance, strengthening the economy or institutions for the nonviolent expression of grievance is found to decrease terrorist mobilization, increase the extremism of terrorist factions, and decrease the likelihood of a splinter faction forming. These results suggest competing micro-level effects of such changes on the expected level of violence that, because they are offsetting, mig},

  Abstract                 = { ABSTRACT What causes the increase in terrorism that reportedly often follows government concessions? Given this pattern, why do governments ever conciliate terrorists? I propose a model in which terrorist organizations become more militant following concessions because only moderate terrorists accept them, leaving extremists in control. Governments nonetheless are willing to make concessions because their counterterror capabilities improve because of the collusion of former terrorists. Former terrorists undertake this collusion to insure the credibility of government promises. The model also yields hypotheses regarding the level of government investment in counterterror, when moderates accept concessions, the terms of negotiated settlements, the duration of terrorist conflicts, incentives for moderate terrorists to radicalize their followers, and incentives for governments to encourage extremist challenges to moderate terrorist leaders. The model is illustrated with an application to the Israeli&sol;Palestinian conflict.Professor Ehud Sprinzak, who died an untimely death on November 8, 2002, first introduced me to the study of terrorism. He is greatly missed.

  Abstract                 = {Many terrorist factions care about the level of popular support they enjoy within a population they claim to represent. Empirically, this level of support can either rise or fall in the aftermath of a campaign of terrorist violence. Under what circumstances is the use of terror an effective tactic for mobilizing political support for an extremist group? This article models a scenario in which an extremist faction considers attacking a government in the hopes of provoking a counterterror response that will radicalize the population, increasing the extremists' support at the expense of a more moderate faction. In our scenario, such radicalization can result either from the economic damage caused by counterterror operations or by the way in which such operations change the population's assessment of the government's motivations. We demonstrate that such attempts at mobilizing public support can be, but need not be, successful, discuss factors that make both the initiation of a terror campaign and successful mobilization more or less likely, and relate our results to several empirical cases.},

  Abstract                 = {We constructed a corpus of digitized texts printed. Analysis of this corpus enables us to investigate cultural trends quantitatively. We survey the vast terrain of âculturomics,â focusing on linguistic and cultural phenomena that were reflected in the English language between 1800 and 2000. We show how this approach can provide insights about fields as diverse as lexicography, the evolution of grammar, collective memory, the adoption of technology, the pursuit of fame, censorship, and historical epidemiology. Culturomics extends the boundaries of rigorous quantitative inquiry to a wide array of new phenomena spanning the social sciences and the humanities.},

  Abstract                 = {In recent years scholars have begun to focus on the consequences of individuals' exposure to civil war, including its severe health and psychological consequences. Our innovation is to move beyond the survey methodology that is widespread in this literature to analyze the actual behavior of individuals with varying degrees of exposure to civil war in a common institutional setting. We exploit the presence of thousands of international soccer (football) players with different exposures to civil conflict in the European professional leagues, and find a strong relationship between the extent of civil conflict in a player's home country and his propensity to behave violently on the soccer field, as measured by yellow and red cards. This link is robust to region fixed effects, country characteristics (e.g. rule of law, per capita income), player characteristics (e.g. age, field position, quality), outliers, and team fixed effects. Reinforcing our claim that we isolate the effect of civil war exposure rather than simple rule breaking or something else entirely, there is no meaningful correlation between our measure of exposure to civil war and soccer performance measures not closely related to violent conduct. The result is also robust to controlling for civil wars before a player's birth, suggesting that it is not driven by factors from the distant historical past.},

Recent work (e.g. Benoit, Laver, and Mikhaylov 2007; Klingemann et. al. 2006, chs. 4â5) focuses on non-systematic sources of error in these estimates that arise from the text generation process. Our concern here, by contrast, is with error that arises during the text coding process, since nearly all manifestos are coded only once by a single coder. First, we discuss reliability and misclassification in the context of hand-coded content analysis methods. Second, we report results of a coding experiment that used trained human coders to code sample manifestos provided by the CMP, allowing us to estimate the reliability of both coders and coding categories. Third, we compare our test codings to the published CMP âgold standardâ codings of the test documents to assess accuracy, and produce empirical estimates of a misclassification matrix for each coding category. Finally, we demonstrate the effect of coding misclassification on the CMPâs most widely used index, its left-right scale, and draw conclusions for future use and design of the CMP data.},

  Abstract                 = {Spatial models of party competition are central to political science, but can only be tested empiri- cally if there exist reliable and valid measurements of agentsâ positions on salient policy dimensions. To date, the main source of cross-national, time-series data on party policy positions comes from from the content analysis of party manifestos by the Comparative Manifesto Project (CMP), cited in hundreds of published studies since the first publication of its results in 1987. Despite the very widespread use of these policy position estimates for studies published in the best journals in our discipline, however, and despite the fact that estimates in these data arise from documents coded only once by one of a handful of CMP coders, the level of uncertainty associated with each CMP estimate has never been characterized. This greatly undermines the value of the CMP dataset as a scientific resource, since even the CMPâs creators agree that their dataset contains several types of error. We propose a remedy to this situation. First, we outline the process by which the CMP data are generated, characterizing the error that arises both from documented tests of coder unreliability, as well as from the inherently stochastic process by which latent party positions are recorded by manifesto authors into observable texts. Second, using previously ignored coding-unit frequencies reported by the CMP project, we reproduce the error-generating process by simulating coder unreli- ability and bootstrapping analyses of coded quasi-sentences to reproduce both forms of error. This allows us to estimate precise levels of non-systematic error for every category and scale reported by the CMP for its entire set of 3,000+ manifestos. Finally, using our estimates of these errors, we demonstrate ways to correct otherwise biased inferences from statistical analyses of the CMP data, and issue recommendations for future research based on CMP measures.},

But little is known about which countries enter into treaties, which forms the treaties take, and which subjects they address. We present an exploratory analysis of a unique dataset of roughly 50,000 treaties ratified since 1946. We hypothesize that states enter treaties in order to obtain public goods but that the transaction costs of negotiating and enforcing treaties also limit the value of treaties. Simple predictions are that larger and richer states should benefit more from cooperation: therefore, they should be parties to more treaties. Older, less corrupt, and (again) larger states should face lower transaction costs and should belong to more treaties. Consistent with this prediction, these states enter into more bilateral treaties and âclosedâ multilateral treaties, but universal multilateral treaties where the benefits of cooperation are more attenuated and the costs of negotiation are low for small states.},

We emphasize the distinction between purchases of goods and services, which are easier to target geographically, and transfers, which are easier to target across social groups. We present a theoretical model in which voters anticipating government policymaking under different electoral systems have an incentive to elect representatives more prone to transfer (public good) spending in proportional (majoritarian) systems. The model also predicts higher total primary spending in proportional (majoritarian) systems when the share of transfer spending is high (low). After defining rigorous measures of proportionality to be used in the empirical investigation, we find considerable support for our predictions.},

In general, therefore, the residual-owners' claims that they will not distort the efficient incentive scheme are not credible. Economic efficiency in the presence of externalities requires the resolution of a fundamentally political problem: the credible commitment of central officials to the implementation of an efficient incentive scheme that is not in their own best interest.},

Furthermore, to what extent do states continue to control IOs once authority has been delegated? Examining a variety of different institutions including the World Trade Organization, the United Nations and the European Commission, this book explores the different methods that states employ to ensure their interests are being served, and identifies the problems involved with monitoring and managing IOs. The contributors suggest that it is not inherently more difficult to design effective delegation mechanisms at international level than at domestic level and, drawing on principal-agent theory, help explain the variations that exist in the extent to which states are willing to delegate to IOs. They argue that IOs are neither all evil nor all virtuous, but are better understood as bureaucracies that can be controlled to varying degrees by their political masters. },

Preceding and concurrent with this move to free trade, there has been a global movement toward democracy. We argue that these two trends are related: democratization of the political system reduces the ability of governments to use trade barriers as a strategy for building political support. Political leaders in labor-rich countries may prefer lower trade barriers as democracy increases. Empirical evidence supports our claim about the developing countries from 1970-99. Regime change toward democracy is associated with trade liberalization, controlling for many factors. Conventional explanations of economic reform, such as economic crises and external pressures, seem less salient. Democratization may have fostered globalization in this period.},

  Abstract                 = {The contemporary press frequently makes mention of, and identifies significance with, specific numerical values in financial markets. This focus has been suggested to result in clustering. Furthermore, these symbolic numbers are often referred to as psychological barriers. These effects are identified as a widespread phenomenon permeating into the economic decision making and financial market environments. This article outlines various arguments and rationale from the cultural, economic, and behavioral literature why clustering and other effects such as psychological barriers may be expected in financial markets. Evidence across a variety of literatures suggests that financial market clustering derives from a variety of sources. There is evidence from a cultural and conventional basis to suggest that number preference exists and that there is a natural tendency to round that derives from the development of the modern decimal system. The literature also provides valid behavioral and economic reasons as to why these effects may occur. However, no evidence is found to support the notion that clustering or barriers in financial markets would occur as a result of a natural order or as a product of the number progression or simply from the numbers themselves.

  Abstract                 = {To accurately assess the relative effectiveness of international environmental agreements requires that we pay greater attention to how problem structures influence both institutional design and the outcomes we use to evaluate institutional effects. Analyzing multiple agreements allows us to move beyond claims that an agreement was influential to claims regarding which variables explain that influence, to examine how institutional influence depends on other factors, and to evaluate an agreement's effectiveness relative to other agreements and non-institutional influences. Accounting for problem structure is crucial to such endeavors because problem structure variables may be alternatives to or interact with institutional variables and because institutional design is endogenous to the problem structure-outcome relationship. The shortcomings related to incorporating problem structure in extant effectiveness research can be overcome through four strategies: carefully describing analytically useful variation in problem structure, selecting cases to limit variation in problem structure, evaluating problem structure variables and their influence on design and behavior, and evaluating effectiveness in terms appropriate to the problem structure.},

  Abstract                 = {International environmental agreements (IEAs), legally binding intergovernmental efforts directed at reducing human impacts on the environment, are common features of global environmental governance. Using a clear definition allowed creation of a comprehensive database [available online at (31)] listing over 700 multilateral agreements (MEAs) and over 1000 bilateral agreements (BEAs), which included treaties, protocols, and amendments that address numerous pollutants; preservation of many species; and, increasingly, protection of various habitats. Research into the factors that explain the timing, content, and membership in environmental agreements clarifies that the interests and power of influential states create pressures for, or constraints on, progress in global enviromnental. governance but that discourse, actors, and processes also play important roles. Variation in the effects of these agreements on environmental behaviors and outcomes often depends as much on characteristics of member countries, the international context, and the underlying environmental problem as on the differences in agreement design.},

In trying to learn enough about these distributions to settle the question, I found a rich and long history, spanning many fields. Indeed, several recently proposed models from the computer science community have antecedents in work from decades ago. Here, I briefly survey some of this history, focusing on underlying generative models that lead to these distributions. One finding is that lognormal and power law distributions connect quite naturally, and hence, it is not surprising that lognormal distributions have arisen as a possible alternative to power law distributions across many fields.},

  Abstract                 = {This note reviews the signalling models presented in the monetary economics literature, and offers a supplementary interpretation regarding the observed US Treasury primacy in signalling. It is argued here that the legal authority given to the US Treasury, under the Gold Reserve Act of 1934, for managing the exchange value of the dollar in international markets provides an avenue for the Treasury, and thus the Administration (i.e., the Executive Branch), to use foreign exchange intervention policy to reduce the credibility of the Federal Reserve's monetary policy. This legal relationship is likely the source of much tension between the two institutions, especially during periods for which the Administration and the Federal Reserve are at odds regarding the proper direction for monetary policy. Given that the Federal Reserve is aware of this implicit power of the Treasury, it should not be surprising that monetary policy signals from that quarter have been found to have a dominant influence on monetary policy.},

  Abstract                 = { Is the political support for welfare policy higher or lower in less egalitarian societies? We answer the question using a model of welfare policy as publicly financed insurance that pays benefits in a redistributive manner. When voters have both redistributive and insurance motives for supporting welfare spending, the effect of inequality depends on how benefits are targeted. Greater inequality increases support for welfare expenditures when benefits are targeted to the employed but decreases support when benefits are targeted to those without earnings. With endogenous targeting, support for benefits to those without earnings declines as inequality increases, whereas support for aggregate spending is a V-shaped function of inequality. Statistical analysis of welfare expenditures in advanced industrial societies provides support for key empirical implications of the model. },

  Abstract                 = {STUDY OBJECTIVES: To develop a single-administration instrument yielding equivalent measures of sleep to those obtained from a formal (2-week) sleep diary. DESIGN & SETTING: A single-administration Sleep riming Questionnaire (STQ) is described (and reproduced in the Appendix). Test-retest reliability was examined in 40 subjects who were given the STQ on two occasions separated by less than 1 year. Convergent validity was measured both by comparing STO-derived measures with objective measures derived from wrist actigraphy (n=23) and by comparing STQ-derived measures with other subjective measures derived from a detailed 2-week sleep diary in two nonoverlapping samples (n=101, 93). Correlations of STQ measures with age and momingness-eveningness (chronotype) were also examined. SUBJECTS: The analyses used sample sizes of 40, 23, 101, and 93 (both genders, overall age range 20y-89y). Most subjects were healthy volunteers; some Study 4 subjects were patients (enrolled in research protocols). RESULTS: Test-retest reliability for the STQ was demonstrated for estimates of bedtime (r = 0.705, p < 0.001) and waketime (r = 0.826, p < 0.001). Convergent validity using wrist actigraphy was demonstrated by correlations of 0.592 (p < 0.005) for bedtime, and of 0.769 (p < 0.001) for waketime. Diary studies indicated STQ bedtime and waketime data to be highly correlated (at about 0.8) with those obtained from a formal 2-week sleep diary. The STQ also provided data on estimated sleep latency and wake after sleep onset (WASO), which correlated reliably (at about 0.7) with average nightly ratings of these variables from a 2-week sleep diary. Mean estimated values of sleep latency and WASO from the two instruments were within 1 minute of each other. ST-derived bedtimes and waketimes correlated with both age and chronotype in the expected direction (older subjects earlier, morning types earlier). CONCLUSION: The STQ may be a reliable valid measure of sleep timing that could provide a time-efficient alternative to traditional sleep diaries.},

Comparisons were made between intersubject and intrasubject variability, as well as a study of overall trends in SRM during the 12 weeks. Two further measures from the instrument--the Activity Level Index (ALI) and Other Person Involvement--were developed and shown to be useful adjuncts to the SRM. Although no simple differences in absolute SRM score emerged between patients and controls, there were significant differences in intersubject vs. intrasubject variability between the two groups. The patients showed more intrasubject variability and required more weeks of sampling to achieve a stable #trait# measure.

The Pittsburgh Sleep Diary (PghSD) is an instrument with separate components to be completed at bedtime and waketime. Bedtime components relate to the events of the day preceding the sleep, waketime components to the sleep period just completed. Two-week PghSD data is presented from 234 different subjects, comprising 96 healthy young middle-aged controls, 37 older men, 44 older women, 29 young adult controls and 28 sleep disorders patients in order to demonstrate the usefulness, validity and reliability of various measures from the instrument. Comparisons are made with polysomnographic and actigraphic sleep measures, as well as personality and circadian type questionnaires. The instrument was shown to have sensitivity in detecting differences due to weekends, age, gender, personality and circadian type, and validity in agreeing with actigraphic estimates of sleep timing and quality. Over a 12201331 month delay, PghSD measures of both sleep timing and sleep quality showed correlations between 0.56 and 0.81 (n= 39, P &lt; 0.001).},

  Abstract                 = { A fundamental tenet of partisan theories of legislative organization is that the majority party is able to generate outcomes that deviate in their preferred direction from the chamber median. While these biased outcomes may be achieved through arm twisting on final passage votes, there is a more efficient means for achieving this bias: restrictive rules. While scholars have recognized this tactic as an important leadership tool in the House, its effectiveness has been often assumed but never empirically tested. We develop a theoretical model that demonstrates how the majority party can use restrictive rules to offer successful proposals to the floor median. More significantly, we test this model using DW-NOMINATE's estimated cut points of final passage roll calls in the House from the 101st to 108th Congress. Our results support the prediction of our model and suggest that majority party leaders achieve biased policy outcomes through the use of restrictive rules.},

In essence, EBMA improves prediction by pooling information from multiple forecast models to generate ensemble predictions similar to a weighted average of component forecasts. The weight assigned to each forecast is calibrated via its performance in some validation period. The aim is not to choose some “best” model, but rather to incorporate the insights and knowledge implicit in various forecasting efforts via statistical postprocessing. After presenting the method, we show that EBMA increases the accuracy of out-of-sample forecasts relative to component models in three applied examples: predicting the occurrence of insurgencies around the Pacific Rim, forecasting vote shares in U.S. presidential elections, and predicting the votes of U.S. Supreme Court Justices.},

Observers disagree, however, about the reasons why European governments have chosen to coordinate core economic policies and surrender sovereign prerogatives. In this eagerly awaited book, Andrew Moravcsik analyzes the history of the region's movement toward economic and political union. Do these unifying steps demonstrate the preeminence of national security concerns, the power of federalist ideals, the skill of political entrepreneurs like Jean Monnet and Jacques Delors, or the triumph of technocratic planning? Moravcsik rejects such views. Economic interdependence has been, he maintains in his provocative argument, the primary force compelling these democracies to move in this surprising direction. Politicians rationally pursued national economic advantage through the exploitation of asymmetrical interdependence and the manipulation of institutional commitments. Focusing on Germany, France, and Britain, Moravcsik examines the five decisive agreements that propelled integration forward. He seeks to reintegrate the historical study of European unity with theoretical inquiry into the sources of international cooperation. },

Each episode collected information on any threat or imposition of economic sanctions from the period from 1971-2000.

  Abstract                 = {Congress, the President, and the Federal Reserve is a study of the politics of monetary policy making at the Federal Reserve--widely considered the most important and most powerful federal bureaucracy. Ostensibly, the Federal Reserve is independent of the political branches of government; however, Congress, the President, and the Federal Reserve clearly demonstrates-- from both a theoretical and empirical standpoint--how the preferences of members of Congress and the President impact decisionmaking at the Fed. Current formal theories of the general policy-making process are utilized to construct an explanatory framework that identifies the mechanisms through which congressional and executive influence is exercised. The theoretical framework presented in the text also helps to explain the political dynamics of several of the most significant policy decisions of the Federal Reserve during the last half-century. In addition, this book provides a unique perspective on the manner in which Fed policymakers attempt to shield themselves from unwelcome political influence. While the main focus of Congress, the President, and the Federal Reserve is monetary policy-making, it also speaks to the political nature of policy-making in a more general sense and provides a guide for the future study of the political dynamics in a wide variety of substantive policy areas. Thus it will interest not only political scientists and economists interested in monetary policy-making specifically but also those interested in the nature of public policy-making more generally.},

  Abstract                 = {During the twentieth century, a system for the treatment of prisonersof war (POWs) was legalized. This system improved the treatment of POWsin some cases, but in others it failed to induce states to abandon theabuse and murder of soldiers who had surrendered to them. My primary aimis to explain the form of the legal rules and the system they haveinduced to handle POWs. My secondary aim is to explain why the systemsucceeds in some cases but not in others.},

  Abstract                 = {This paper presents and solves a crisis bargaining game under limited information. The sides alternate offers from three possible offers, with war and its costs starting if the target's counteroffer is rejected. The equilibrium of the model falls into four different cases. These four cases are analyzed to determine how the sides communicate through their offers and how the costs of war, initial beliefs, misperceptions, and distribution of capabilities drive the probabilities of a crisis and war. The model demonstrates a joint selection bias-misspecification problem in empirical studies of crises arising from the unobservable nature of beliefs. Several empirical studies of crisis bargaining are discussed in the light of this methodological problem, new patterns of evidence are found that support the presence of the selection problem, and their conclusions are reexamined.},

  Abstract                 = {We test three arguments about the effect of international politics on trade flows. The first argument states that trade flows are greater between states with similar interests than those with dissimilar interests, the second that trade flows are greater in democratic dyads than nondemocratic dyads, and the third that trade flows are greater between allies. We examine trade flows between the major powers from 1907 to 1990. This period provides variation on all three independent variables of interest and allows us to separate the three arguments empirically. We estimate a gravity model of trade with the above political variables added. Our results demonstrate that joint democracy and common interests increase trade in a dyad, but alliances generally do not, even when controlling for polarity of the system.},

  Abstract                 = {A central research question in international political economy concerns the influence of financial markets on government policy outcomes. To what extent does international capital mobility limit government policy choices? I evaluate the relationship between international financial markets and government policy outcomes, with a focus on the government bond market in developed democracies. Evidence includes interviews with financial market participants and a cross-sectional time-series analysis of the determinants of interest rates. This evaluation suggests that governments of developed democracies face strong but narrowly defined financial market pressures. Financial market participants are concerned with a few macroeconomic policy indicators, including inflation rates and government deficit/GDP ratios, but not with micropolicy indicators, such as the distribution of government spending across functional categories. In these areas, governments retain policymaking autonomy. I conclude by exploring the role of financial market influences within domestic politics and offering suggestions for further research.},

  Abstract                 = {The two workhorse models of trade, Heckscher-Ohlin and Ricardo-Viner, provide leverage in explaining how societal groups divide over trade protection. Tension between the two trade models has significantly influenced the scholarship of trade politics, with explanations of trade politics adopting either the factor-based approach or the industry- based framework. No study has investigated how changes in factor mobility as a continuous variable influence the change in trade protection as a policy outcome. Building on recent scholarship on factor mobility, this article models explicitly how intersectoral labor (im)mobility and political competition between parties affect changes in trade protection in majoritarian democracies. The theoretical model predicts that when intersectoral labor mobility decreases governments in majoritarian democracies are more likely to raise trade barriers. We test this prediction in a time-series, cross-sectional sample of 32 OECD and non-OECD majoritarian democracies observed between 1980 and 2000. The empirical results corroborate our theory and remain robust when we control for alternative explanations, employ different estimation techniques, and use different measures of trade protection.},

  Abstract                 = {A comprehensive and integrated framework for the analysis of data is offered and used to assess data sets on democracy. The framework first distinguishes among three challenges that are sequentially addressed: conceptualization, measurement, and aggregation. In turn, it specifies distinct tasks associated with these challenges and the standards of assessment that pertain to each task. This framework is applied to the data sets on democracy most frequently used in current statistical research, generating a systematic evaluation of these data sets. The authorsâ conclusion is that constructors of democracy indices tend to be quite self-conscious about methodological issues but that even the best indices suffer from important weaknesses. More constructively, the articleâs assessment of existing data sets on democracy identifies distinct areas in which attempts to improve the quality of data on democracy might fruitfully be focused.},

  Abstract                 = {In empirical analysis of data consisting of repeated observations on economic units (time series on a cross section) it is often assumed that the coefficients of the quantitative variables (slopes) are the same, whereas the coefficients of the qualitative variables (intercepts or effects) vary over units or periods.This is the constant-slope variable-intercept framework. In such an analysis an explicit account should be taken of the statistical dependence that exists between the quantitative variables and the effects. It is shown that when this is done, the random effect approach and the fixed effect approach yield the same estimate for the slopes, the "within" estimate. Any matrix combination of the "within" and "between" estimates is generally biased. When the "within" estimate is subject to a relatively large error a minimum mean square error can be applied, as is generally done in regression analysis. Such an estimator is developed here from a somewhat different point of departure.},

  Abstract                 = {A neoclassical growth model is used to empirically test for the influences of a civil war on steady-state income per capita both at home and in neighboring countries. This model provides the basis for measuring long-run and short-run effects of civil wars on income per capita growth in the host country and its neighbors. Evidence of significant collateral damage on economic growth in neighboring nations is uncovered. In addition, this damage is attributed to country-specific influences rather than to migration, human capital, or investment factors. As the intensity of the measure used to proxy the conflict increases, there are enhanced neighbor spillovers. Moreover, collateral damage from civil wars to growth is more pronounced in the short run.},

If the host is aggressive, refugees will retaliate, depending on whether the camps are militarized whereby refugees will have access to weapons and arms. Camp militarization, in turn, depends on factors such as rebel infiltration and the location of camps. Furthermore, the paper finds that alliances between host and sending countries have a pacifying effect. On the hand, while international organizations are able to shape host behavior to a certain extent, they are unable to prevent camp militarization. Such findings have policy implications for hosts, sending states and international organizations.},

Unlike previous attempts that concentrate on problems such as matrix elements weighting, space dimensionality selection, similarity measure etc., we primarily study the impact of another, often neglected, but fundamental element of LSA (and of any text processing technique): the definition of "word". For the purpose, a balanced corpus of Bulgarian newspaper texts was carefully created, to allow for in-depth observations of the LSA performance, and series of experiments were performed in order to understand and compare (with respect to the task of text categorisation) six possible inputs with different level of linguistic quality, including: graphemic form as met in the text, stem, lemma, phrase, lemma&phrase and part-of-speech annotation. In addition to LSA, we made comparisons to the standard vector-space model, without any dimensionality reduction. The results show that while the linguistic processing has a substantial influence on the LSA performance, the traditional factors are even more important, and therefore we did not prove that the linguistic pre-processing substantially improves text categorisation.},

We discovered that play is characterized by a multiplicity of collaborations from brief informal encounters to highly organized play in structured groups. The variety of collaborations makes the game more fun and provides rich learning opportunities. We contrast these varied collaborations, including those with strangers, to the "gold standard" of Gemeinschaft-like communities of close relations in tightknit groups.

By comparing adjacent versions of the same article, we extract voluminous training data for tasks for which data is usually scarce or costly to obtain. We illustrate this paradigm by applying it to three separate text processing tasks at various levels of linguistic granularity. We first apply this approach to the collection of textual errors and their correction, focusing on the specific type of lexical errors known as âeggcornsâ. Second, moving up to the sentential level, we show how to mineWikipedia revisions for training sentence compression algorithms. By dramatically increasing the size of the available training data, we are able to create more discerning lexicalized models, providing improved compression results. Finally, moving up to the document level, we present some preliminary ideas on how to use the Wikipedia data to bootstrap text summarization systems. We propose to use a sentenceâs persistence throughout a documentâs evolution as an indicator of its fitness as part of an extractive summary. Introduction},

The selforganizing maps are iteratively adapted to minimize the edit distance of those graphs that are required to be similar. To demonstrate the learning e ect, the distance model is applied to graphs representing line drawings and diatoms.},

We present conditions for obtaining cosistency and asymptotic normality of a very general class of estimators (extremum estimators). Consistent asymptotic variance estimators are given to enable approximation of the asymptotic distribution. Asymptotic efficiency is another desirable property then considered. Throughout the chapter, the general results are also specialized to common econometric estimators (e.g. MLE and GMM), and in specific examples we work through the conditions for the various results in detail. The results are also extended to two-step estimators (with finite-dimensional parameter estimation in the first step), estimators derived from nonsmooth objective functions, and semiparametric two-step estimators (with nonparametric estimation of an infinite-dimensional parameter in the first step). Finally, the trinity of test statistics is considered within the quite general setting of GMM estimation, and numerous examples are given.},

Power laws appear widely in physics, biology, earth and planetary sciences, economics and finance, computer science, demography and the social sciences. For instance, the distributions of the sizes of cities, earthquakes, forest fires, solar flares, moon craters and people???s personal fortunes all appear to follow power laws. The origin of power-law behaviour has been a topic of debate in the scientific community for more than a century. Here we review some of the empirical evidence for the existence of power-law forms and the theories proposed to explain them.},

Betweenness is, in some sense, a measure of the influence a node has over the spread of information through the network. By counting only shortest paths, however, the conventional definition implicitly assumes that information spreads only along those shortest paths. Here we propose a betweenness measure that relaxes this assumption, including contributions from essentially all paths between nodes, not just the shortest, although it still gives more weight to short paths. The measure is based on random walks, counting how often a node is traversed by a random walk between two other nodes. We show how our measure can be calculated using matrix methods, and give some examples of its application to particular networks.},

We also propose a measure for the strength of the community structure found by our algorithms, which gives us an objective metric for choosing the number of communities into which a network should be divided. We demonstrate that our algorithms are highly effective at discovering community structure in both computer-generated and real-world network data, and show how they can be used to shed light on the sometimes dauntingly complex structure of networked systems.},

In this paper we develop in detail the theory of random graphs with arbitrary degree distributions. In addition to simple undirected, unipartite graphs, we examine the properties of directed and bipartite graphs. Among other results, we derive exact expressions for the position of the phase transition at which a giant component first forms, the mean component size, the size of the giant component if there is one, the mean number of vertices a certain distance away from a randomly chosen vertex, and the average vertex-vertex distance within a graph. We apply our theory to some real-world graphs, including the world-wide web and collaboration graphs of scientists and Fortune 1000 company directors. We demonstrate that in some cases random graphs with appropriate distributions of vertex degree predict with surprising accuracy the behavior of the real world, while in others there is a measurable discrepancy between theory and reality, perhaps indicating the presence of additional social structure in the network that is not captured by the random graph.},

Here we point out that weighted networks can in many cases be analyzed using a simple mapping from a weighted network to an unweighted multigraph, allowing us to apply standard techniques for unweighted graphs to weighted ones as well.

  Abstract                 = {Current international relations theory struggles to explain both the autonomy and transformation of international organizations (IOs). Previous theories either fail to account for any IO behavior that deviates from the interests of member states, or neglect the role of member states in reforming IO institutions and behavior. We propose an agency theory of IOs that can fill these gaps while also addressing two persistent problems in the study of IOs: common agency and long delegation chains. Our model explains slippage between member states\&apos; interests and IO behavior, but also suggests institutional mechanisms\&mdash;staff selection, monitoring, procedural checks, and contracts\&mdash;through which states can rein in errant IOs. We evaluate this argument by examining multiple institutional reforms and lending patterns at the World Bank from 1980 to 2000.Several people gave us helpful comments on earlier drafts of the manuscript.

  Abstract                 = {The traditional view of appointments to executive agencies is that the president has virtual carte blanche in the selection of personnel for his "team." Yet many formal models of appointment suggest that presidents must accommodate the policy preferences of senators when making nominations. Several empirical studies have confirmed that legislative preferences are a significant determinant of the ideology of appointees, but these studies have focused on appointments to the federal judiciary; the research has not addressed appointments to executive agencies. Appointments to executive agencies from 1936 to 1996 are examined, by employing a special sample of appointees to those positions--those who have served in Congress at some point in their careers. For these "bridging" individuals, it is possible to analyze strictly comparable measures of ideology for the appointees, their nominating presidents, and the senators who voted to confirm them. A linear regression analysis provides significant support for the hypothesis that appointee ideology is affected by variation in the ideological tilt in Congress.},

  Abstract                 = {From 1865 to 1870, a crisis atmosphere hovered around the issue of the massive public debt created during the recently concluded Civil War, leading, in part, to the passage of a Constitutional Amendment ensuring the “validity of the public debt.” However, the Civil War debt crisis was not a financial one, but a political one. The Republican and Democratic Parties took concerns over the public debt and magnified them into panics so that they could serve political ends — there was never any real danger that the United States would default on its debt for financial reasons. There were, in fact, three interrelated crises generated during the period: a repudiation crisis (grounded upon fears of the cancellation of the war debt), a repayment crisis (arising from calls to repay the debt in depreciated currency), and a refunding crisis (stemming from a concern of a run on the Treasury). The end of the Civil War debt crisis came only when there was no more political advantage to be gained from exploiting the issue of the public debt.},

By drawing on the literature of political economy, for example, economic historians can explore how institutions have interacted to affect economic performance over time. },

It focuses on the relationship between institutions and the behavior of the government and interprets the institutional changes on the basis of the goals of the winnersâsecure property rights, protection of their wealth, and the elimination of confiscatory government. We argue that the new institutions allowed the government to commit credibly to upholding property rights. Their success was remarkable, as the evidence from capital markets shows. },

  Abstract                 = {Military planners and other decision makers require advanced early warning of impending crises so they can devise effective mitigation plans, mobilize resources, and coordinate responses with their foreign counterparts. Over the last 40Â years, the US government has invested generously in several attempts to build crisis forecasting systems that were analytically defensible and capable of processing and making sense of vast amounts of information in real or near real time. This article describes the most recent attempt by the US military to develop an Integrated Crisis Early Warning System (ICEWS). Although ICEWS relies heavily on social science theories, data, and methods, our experiences thus far reveal some strengths and limitations of contemporary quantitative approaches to addressing social science questions with real world implications. The article concludes with a sketch of a new paradigmatic approachâa Computational Social Science Experimentation Proving Groundâthat could not only improve crisis early warning and response, but also revolutionize how social science knowledge is developed, evaluated, and applied more broadly.},

Relative price evidence indicates that these blockades and embargos did restrict trade, and that Britain was less severely affected than her rivals. Benchmark welfare estimates for the United States are particularly high, at roughly per annum. While absolute welfare estimates depend on elasticity assumptions, the US unambiguously came out worst in these disputes, and Britain almost surely suffered lower losses than France as well.},

  Abstract                 = {The paper provides a comparative history of the economic impact of the Revolutionary and Napoleonic Wars. By focusing on the relative price evidence, it is possible to show that the conflict had major economic effects around the world. BritainÃâs control of the seas meant that it was much less affected than other belligerent nations, such as France and the United States. The fact that this conflict had such large price effects around the world suggests a highly inter-connected international economy, but is also consistent with the hypothesis that mercantilist conflicts prevented the emergence of more pronounced commodity market integration during the eighteenth century. The war had several longer-run effects which both helped and hindered the integration of international commodity markets during the nineteenth century.},

Broadening the franchise involves transferring power from non-elected elites to the wider population, most of whom will be workers. The Hecksher-Ohlin-Stolper-Samuelson logic says that democratization should lead to more liberal trade policies in countries where workers stand to gain from free trade; and to more protectionist policies in countries where workers will benefit from the imposition of tariffs and quotas. We test and confirm these political economy implications of trade theory hypothesis using data on democracy, factor endowments, and protection in the late nineteenth century.},

  Abstract                 = {A growing literature argues that international financial integration has eliminated the possibility for distinct partisan macroeconomic strategies. I test this hypothesis by reformulating the partisan hypothesis in an open-economy context and conducting pooled time-series analysis of budget balances, real interest rates, and capital controls for fourteen OECD countries between 1970 and 1994. The analysis provides little evidence that financial integration has eliminated distinct partisan macroeconomic policies. Under fixed exchange rates leftist governments run larger deficits than rightist governments and use capital controls to reduce interest rate premia. Under floating exchange rates leftist governments pursue looser monetary policies than rightist governments. While partisan distinctions do weaken in the 1990s in countries with fixed exchange rates, this is attributed to the recession of the early 1990s and to important institutional changes in the European Union. International financial integration, therefore, does not prevent governments from pursuing distinct partisan macroeconomic policies.},

Shifting from thisbilateral system to a multilateral clearing union could have provided arst step toward trade expansion.

  Abstract                 = {Once one recognizes that governments borrow international reserves and exercise other policy options to defend fixed exchange rates during currency crises, the question arises: What factors determine a government's decision to abandon a currency peg or hang on? In a setting of purposeful action by the authorities, the possibility of self-fulfilling crises becomes important. Speculative anticipations depend on conjectured government responses, which depend, in turn, on how price changes that are themselves fueled by expectations affect the government's economic and political positions. The circular dynamic implies a potential for crises that need not have occurred, but that do because market participants expect them to. In contrast to this picture, most previous literature on balance-of- payments crises ignores the response of government behavior to markets. That literature, I argue, throws little light on events such as the European Exchange Rate Mechanism collapse of 1992-93. This paper then presents two different models in which crisis and realignment result from the interaction of rational private economic actors and a government that pursues well-defined policy goals. In both, arbitrary expectational shifts can turn a fairly credible exchange-rate peg into a fragile one.},

Expressed as deviations from a true parity measure and conjoined with existing data for 1835-1900, the series permit an examination of the stability of the gold points over the entire nineteenth century. The steady narrowing of metallic points, previously found for 1835-1900 and confirmed here, does not apply to the earlier period; but evidence suggests that movement to an integrated market in foreign exchange developed in the 1820s.},

  Abstract                 = {Some leading modern theories of exchange-rate determination are pitted against each other in explaining fundamental movements of the freely floating U.S. dollar in the foreign-exchange market during the greenback period, 1862-1878. A purchasing-power-parity theory augmented to incorporate interest-rate, and possibly income, effects provides the best explanation of the exchange rate. The standard works on the greenback period are subject to some amendments in light of the study.},

  Abstract                 = {Ideal point estimates are a boon to the operationalization of spatial models in political science, partic- ularly those interested in political elites. Application of these estimates has extended beyond the natural single-chamber setting in attempts to place a wider range of actors in a common space. âBridgingâ, the use of implicit votes to connect natural chambers, has admitted comparable estimates in the American setting for actors from both chambers of Congress, actors in all three federal branches, and actors from both the state and national level legislatures. I use Monte Carlo analysis to show that under conditions similar to those where bridging is applied, bridged estimates can be much less accurate than those associ- ated with standard single-chamber problems and, sometimes, less accurate than those associated with the assumption of direct comparability. Broadly put, my ï¬ndings challenge the conventional wisdom that has emerged in applied work by showing that bridging does not always admit comparability.},

  Abstract                 = {Recent research indicates that democracy and economic interdependence reduce the probability that a pair of states will engage in a militarized interstate dispute. These analyses were largely confined to the cold war era, however, leading some to argue that the results are an artifact of the particular bipolar configuration of alliances and interests characteristic of that period. To determine whether this is so, we present two sets of analyses here. First, with new trade data for sixteen countries, 1870-1989, we use logistic analysis of cross-sectional and rime-series data to test whether democracy and economic openness (total exports as a proportion of gross domestic product) had the same conflict-reducing effects before World War II as after. We find they did, while the effect of alliances is weak. Moreover, our theoretical model offers a plausible explanation of the outbreak of World War I that is consistent with the liberal peace. Second, for the cold war era, we address the question of whether states' interests or preferences offer a better explanation of interstate conflict than do democracy and interdependence. We conclude that states' preferences, as indicated by the similarity of states' voting in the UN General Assembly, are closely associated with the probability of a dispute; but these preferences are in rum significantly influenced by the character of states' political regimes and their economic relations. Liberal states do not fight because they have little to fight about, but they have little to fight about because of the shared interests reflected in democratic institutions and open markets.},

  Abstract                 = {Previous studies provide strong evidence for the Kantian theory of peace, but a satisfactory evaluation requires establishing the causal influence of the variables. Here we focus on the reciprocal relations between economic interdependence and interstate conflict, 188520131992. Using distributed-lags analyses, we find that economically important trade does have a substantively important effect in reducing dyadic militarized disputes, even with extensive controls for the influence of past conflict. The benefit of interdependence is particularly great in the case of conflict involving military fatalities. Militarized disputes also cause a reduction in trade, as liberal theory predicts. Democracy and joint membership in intergovernmental organizations, too, have im-portant pacific benefits; but we find only limited support for the role of costly signals in establishing the liberal peace. We find no evidence that democratization increases the incidence of interstate disputes; and contrary to realists' expectations, allies are not less conflict prone than states that are not allied. Democracies and states that share membership in many international organizations have higher levels of trade, but allies do not when these influences are held constant.},

  Abstract                 = {The liberals believed that economic interdependence, as well as democracy, would reduce the incidence of interstate conflict. In this article, we test both their economic and their political prescriptions for peace, using pooled-regression analyses of politically relevant dyads for the Cold War era. We find that the pacific benefits of trade, both total and dyadic, have not been sufficiently appreciated. We also offer clear evidence that democracies are relatively unlikely to become involved in militarized disputes with other democracies, while autocracies and democracies are prone to conflict with each other. Since democratic dyads are more peaceful than autocratic dyads, it follows that democracies are more peaceful than autocratic states generally, ceteris paribus. Previous research at the national level of analysis, which led most to conclude that democracies have been no more peaceful than other states, did not consider that the incidence of conflict depends importantly upon the number of contiguous states, the character of their political regimes, and other factors. In addition, we find no evidence that states that have recently undergone regime changes, whether in the democratic or autocratic direction, are particularly conflict prone. Our results suggest the basis for a broader formulation of expected-utility theories of interstate conflict.},

We introduce subgraph intensity as the geometric mean of its link weights and coherence as the ratio of the geometric to the corresponding arithmetic mean. Using these measures, motif scores and clustering coefficient can be generalized to weighted networks. To demonstrate these concepts, we apply them to financial and metabolic networks and find that inclusion of weights may considerably modify the conclusions obtained from the study of unweighted characteristics.},

  Abstract                 = {Historians have long wondered whether the Southern Confederacy had a realistic chance at winning the American Civil War. We provide some quantitative evidence on this question by introducing a new methodology for estimating the probability of winning a civil war or revolution based on decisions in financial markets. Using a unique dataset of Confederate gold bonds in Amsterdam, we apply this methodology to estimate the probability of a Southern victory from the summer of 1863 until the end of the war. Our results suggest that European investors gave the Confederacy approximately a 42 percent chance of victory prior to the battle of Gettysburg/Vicksburg. News of the severity of the two rebel defeats led to a sell-off in Confederate bonds. By the end of 1863, the probability of a Southern victory fell to about 15 percent. Confederate victory prospects generally decreased for the remainder of the war. The analysis also suggests that McClellan's possible election as U.S. President on a peace party platform as well as Confederate military victories in 1864 did little to reverse the market's assessment that the South would probably lose the Civil War.},

  Abstract                 = {The theme of this yearâs Report is âTrade policy commitments and contingency measuresâ. The Report examines the range of contingency measures available in trade agreements and the role that these measures play. Also referred to as escape clauses or safety valves, these measures allow governments a certain degree of flexibility within their trade commitments and can be used to address circumstances that could not have been foreseen when a trade commitment was made. Contingency measures seek to strike a balance between commitments and flexibility. Too much flexibility may undermine the value of commitments, but too little may render the rules unsustainable. The tension between credible commitments and flexibility is often close to the surface during trade negotiations. For example, in the July 2008 mini-ministerial meeting, which sought to agree negotiating modalities â or a final blueprint â for agriculture and non-agricultural market access (NAMA), the question of a âspecial safeguard mechanismâ (the extent to which developing countries would be allowed to protect farmers from import surges) was crucial to the discussions. One of the main objectives of this Report is to analyze whether WTO provisions provide a balance between supplying governments with necessary flexibility to face difficult economic situations and adequately defining them in a way that limits their use for protectionist purposes. In analyzing this question, the Report focuses primarily on contingency measures available to WTO members when importing and exporting goods. These measures include the use of safeguards, such as tariffs and quotas, in specified circumstances, anti-dumping duties on goods that are deemed to be âdumpedâ, and countervailing duties imposed to offset subsidies. The Report also discusses alternative policy options, including the renegotiation of tariff commitments, the use of export taxes, and increases in tariffs up to their legal maximum ceiling or binding. The analysis includes consideration of legal, economic and political economy factors that influence the use of these measures and their associated benefits and costs. },

The main novelty of the data is the record of all listing price changes and all offers ever made on a property since it appears on the market, as well as all the visits by potential buyers for a subset of the sample. We analyze individual seller and potential buyers behavior within property transaction histories. This leads us to establish a number of stylized facts pertaining specifically to the timing and terms of agreement in housing transactions, and more generally, to the sequence of events that occur from initial listing to sale agreement.},

  Abstract                 = { In many Asian countries the ratio of male to female population is higher than in the West: as high as 1.07 in China and India, and even higher in Pakistan. A number of authors (most notably Amartya Sen) have suggested that this imbalance reflects excess female mortality and have argued that as many as 100 million women are Ã¢ÂÂmissing.Ã¢ÂÂ This paper proposes an explanation for some of the observed overrepresentation of men: the hepatitis B virus. I present new evidence, consistent with an existing scientific literature, that carriers of the hepatitis B virus have offspring sex ratios around 1.50 boys for each girl. This evidence includes both crossÃ¢ÂÂcountry analyses and a natural experiment based on recent vaccination campaigns. Hepatitis B is common in many Asian countries, especially China, where some 10Ã¢ÂÂ15 percent of the population is infected. Using data on prevalence of the virus by country and estimates of the effect of hepatitis on the sex ratio, I argue that hepatitis B can account for about 45 percent of the Ã¢ÂÂmissing womenÃ¢ÂÂ: around 75 percent in China, between 20 and 50 percent in Egypt and western Asia, and under 20 percent in India, Bangladesh, Pakistan, and Nepal. },

  Abstract                 = {A major problem worldwide is the potential loss of fisheries, forests, and water resources. Understanding of the processes that lead to improvements in or deterioration of natural resources is limited, because scientific disciplines use different concepts and languages to describe and explain complex social-ecological systems (SESs). Without a common framework to organize findings, isolated knowledge does not cumulate. Until recently, accepted theory has assumed that resource users will never self-organize to maintain their resources and that governments must impose solutions. Research in multiple disciplines, however, has found that some government policies accelerate resource destruction, whereas some resource users have invested their time and energy to achieve sustainability. A general framework is used to identify 10 subsystem variables that affect the likelihood of self-organization in efforts to achieve a sustainable SES.},

  Abstract                 = {The analysis of how institutions are formed, how they operate and change, and how they influence behavior in society has become a major subject of inquiry in politics, sociology, and economics. A leader in applying game theory to the understanding of institutional analysis, Elinor Ostrom provides in this book a coherent method for undertaking the analysis of diverse economic, political, and social institutions. Understanding Institutional Diversityexplains the Institutional Analysis and Development (IAD) framework, which enables a scholar to choose the most relevant level of interaction for a particular question. This framework examines the arena within which interactions occur, the rules employed by participants to order relationships, the attributes of a biophysical world that structures and is structured by interactions, and the attributes of a community in which a particular arena is placed. The book explains and illustrates how to use the IAD in the context of both field and experimental studies. Concentrating primarily on the rules aspect of the IAD framework, it provides empirical evidence about the diversity of rules, the calculation process used by participants in changing rules, and the design principles that characterize robust, self-organized resource governance institutions.},

  Abstract                 = {Extensive empirical evidence and theoretical developments in multiple disciplines stimulate a need to expand the range of rational choice models to be used as a foundation for the study of social dilemmas and collective action. After an introduction to the problem of overcoming social dilemmas through collective action, the remainder of this article is divided into six sections. The first briefly reviews the theoretical predictions of currently accepted rational choice theory related to social dilemmas. The second section summarizes the challenges to the sole reliance on a complete model of rationality presented by extensive experimental research. In the third section, I discuss two major empirical findings that begin to show how individuals achieve results that are "better than rational" by building conditions where reciprocity, reputation, and trust can help to overcome the strong temptations of short-run self-interest. The fourth section raises the possibility of developing second-generation models of rationality, the fifth section develops an initial theoretical scenario, and the final section concludes by examining the implications of placing reciprocity, reputation, and trust at the core of an empirically tested, behavioral theory of collective action.},

  Abstract                 = {Contemporary political theory often assumes that individuals cannot make credible commitments where substantial temptations exist to break them unless such commitments are enforced by an external agent. One such situation may occur in relation to common pool resources, which are natural or man-made resources whose yield is subtractable and whose exclusion is nontrivial (but not necessarily impossible). Examples include fisheries, forests, grazing ranges, irrigation systems, and groundwater basins. Empirical evidence, however, suggests that appropriators in common pool resources develop credible commitments in many cases without relying on external authorities. We present findings from a series of experiments exploring (1) covenants alone (both one-shot and repeated communication opportunities); (2) swords alone (repeated opportunities to sanction each other); and (3) covenants combined with an internal sword (one-shot communication followed by repeated opportunities to sanction each other).},

In contrast to standard social psychological approaches, based on such natural language terms as greed, fear, and trust, the Bayesian approach provides a rigorous mathematical treatment of social participation. This theory is shown to make strong testable predictions that can integrate data collected across a wide variety of natural and experimental settings. The altruism model is shown to be supported by existing experimental data on binary voluntary contribution games.},

  Abstract                 = {Many complex systems in nature and society can be described in terms of networks capturing the intricate web of connections among the units they are made of1, 2, 3, 4. A key question is how to interpret the global organization of such networks as the coexistence of their structural subunits (communities) associated with more highly interconnected parts. Identifying these a priori unknown building blocks (such as functionally related proteins5, 6, industrial sectors7 and groups of people8, 9) is crucial to the understanding of the structural and functional properties of networks. The existing deterministic methods used for large networks find separated communities, whereas most of the actual networks are made of highly overlapping cohesive groups of nodes. Here we introduce an approach to analysing the main statistical features of the interwoven sets of overlapping communities that makes a step towards uncovering the modular structure of complex systems. After defining a set of new characteristic quantities for the statistics of communities, we apply an efficient technique for exploring overlapping communities on a large scale. We find that overlaps are significant, and the distributions we introduce reveal universal features of networks. Our studies of collaboration, word-association and protein interaction graphs show that the web of communities has non-trivial correlations and specific scaling properties.},

Compared to the extant methods, such as quasi-ML, GCM, and and simulation-based ML estimators, the current method does not rely on the properties of the big variance-covariance matrix or the shape of the likelihood func- tion. In addition, the present model efficiently handles high-order autocorrelated errors that raise computationally formidable difficulties to the conventional methods. By applying a mixed sampler of the Gibbs and Metropolis-Hastings algorithm, the posterior distributions of the parameters do not depend on initial observations. The auxiliary particle filter, complemented by the fixed-lag smoothing, is extended to approximate Bayes Factors for models with latent high-order Markov processes. Computational methods are tested with empirical data. Energy cooperation policies of the International Energy Agency are analyzed in terms of their effects on global oil-supply security. The current model with different lag orders, together with other competitive models, is estimated and compared.},

In this setup a two-component mixture dis- tribution is stipulated for coefficients of interest with one part centered at zero with very high precision (the spike) and the other as a distribution diffusely centered at the research hypothesis (the slab). With the selective shrinkage, this setup incorporates the zero coefficient contingency directly into the modeling process to produce pos- terior probabilities for hypothesized outcomes. We extend the model to qualitative responses by designing a hierarchy of forms over both the parameter and model spaces to achieve variable selection, model averaging, and individual coefficient hypothesis testing. To overcome the technical challenges in estimating the marginal posterior distributions possibly with a dramatic ratio of density heights of the spike to the slab, we develop a hybrid Gibbs sampling algorithm using an adaptive rejection ap- proach for various discrete outcome models, including dichotomous, polychotomous, and count responses. The performance of the models and methods are assessed with both Monte Carlo experiments and empirical applications in political science.},

  Abstract                 = { ABSTRACT Suicide terrorism is rising around the world, but the most common explanations do not help us understand why. Religious fanaticism does not explain why the world leader in suicide terrorism is the Tamil Tigers in Sri Lanka, a group that adheres to a Marxist&sol;Leninist ideology, while existing psychological explanations have been contradicted by the widening range of socio-economic backgrounds of suicide terrorists. To advance our understanding of this growing phenomenon, this study collects the universe of suicide terrorist attacks worldwide from 1980 to 2001, 188 in all. In contrast to the existing explanations, this study shows that suicide terrorism follows a strategic logic, one specifically designed to coerce modern liberal democracies to make significant territorial concessions. Moreover, over the past two decades, suicide terrorism has been rising largely because terrorists have learned that it pays. Suicide terrorists sought to compel American and French military forces to abandon Lebanon in 1983, Israeli forces to leave Lebanon in 1985, Israeli forces to quit the Gaza Strip and the West Bank in 1994 and 1995, the Sri Lankan government to create an independent Tamil state from 1990 on, and the Turkish government to grant autonomy to the Kurds in the late 1990s. In all but the case of Turkey, the terrorist political cause made more gains after the resort to suicide operations than it had before. Thus, Western democracies should pursue policies that teach terrorists that the lesson of the 1980s and 1990s no longer holds, policies which in practice may have more to do with improving homeland security than with offensive military action.I thank Robert Art, Mia Bloom, Steven C&iacute;cala, Alex Downs, Daniel Drezner, Adria Lawrence, Sean Lynn-Jones, John Mearsheimer, Michael O&apos;Connor, Sebastian Rosato, Lisa Weeden, the anonymous reviewers, and the members of the program on International Security Policy at the University of Chicago for their superb comments.

  Abstract                 = {In this paper, I introduce changepoint models for binary and ordered time series data based on Chib's hidden Markov model. The extension of the changepoint model to a binary probit model is straightforward in a Bayesian setting. However, detecting parameter breaks from ordered regression models is difficult because ordered time series data often have clustering along the break points. To address this issue, I propose an estimation method that uses the linear regression likelihood function for the sampling of hidden states of the ordinal probit changepoint model. The marginal likelihood method is used to detect the number of hidden regimes. I evaluate the performance of the introduced methods using simulated data and apply the ordinal probit changepoint model to the study of Eichengreen, Watson, and Grossman on violations of the ârules of the gameâ of the gold standard by the Bank of England during the interwar period.},

In this article, I investigate historical changes in the use of force by U.S. presidents using Bayesian changepoint analysis. In doing so, I present an integrated Bayesian approach for analyzing changepoint problems in a Poisson regression model. To find the nature of the breaks, I estimate parameters of the Poisson regression changepoint model using Chib's (1998) hidden Markov model algorithm and FrÃ¼hwirth-Schnatter and Wagner's (2006) data augmentation method. Then, I utilize transdimensional Markov chain Monte Carlo methods to detect the number of breaks. Analyzing yearly use of force data from 1890 to 1995, I find that, controlling for the effects of the Great Depression and the two world wars, the relationship between domestic conditions and the frequency of the use of force abroad fundamentally shifted in the 1940s.},

  Abstract                 = { Researchers working with panel data sets often face situations where changes in unobserved factors have produced changes in the cross-sectional heterogeneity across time periods. Unfortunately, conventional statistical methods for panel data are based on the assumption that the unobserved cross-sectional heterogeneity is time constant. In this paper, I introduce statistical methods to diagnose and model changes in the unobserved heterogeneity. First, I develop three combinations of a hidden Markov model with panel data models using the Bayesian framework; (1) a baseline hidden Markov panel model with varying fixed effects and varying random effects; (2) a hidden Markov panel model with varying fixed effects; and (3) a hidden Markov panel model with varying intercepts. Second, I present model selection methods to diagnose the dynamic heterogeneity using the marginal likelihood method and the reversible jump Markov chain Monte Carlo method. I illustrate the utility of these methods using two important ongoing political economy debates; the relationship between income inequality and economic growth and the effect of institutions on income inequality. },

  Abstract                 = { The Lasso estimate for linear regression parameters can be interpreted as a Bayesian posterior mode estimate when the regression parameters have independent Laplace (i.e., double-exponential) priors. Gibbs sampling from this posterior is possible using an expanded hierarchy with conjugate normal priors for the regression parameters and independent exponential priors on their variances. A connection with the inverse-Gaussian distribution provides tractable full conditional distributions. The Bayesian Lasso provides interval estimates (Bayesian credible intervals) that can guide variable selection. Moreover, the structure of the hierarchical model provides both Bayesian and likelihood methods for selecting the Lasso parameter. Slight modifications lead to Bayesian versions of other Lasso-related estimation methods, including bridge regression and a robust variant. },

We assume the frequentist framework where the data is generated according to a fixed mean vector. We show that if the number of nonzero parameters of the mean vector is known, the horseshoe estimator attains the minimax $\ell_2$ risk, possibly up to a multiplicative constant. We provide conditions under which the horseshoe estimator combined with an empirical Bayes estimate of the number of nonzero means still yields the minimax risk. We furthermore prove an upper bound on the rate of contraction of the posterior distribution around the horseshoe estimator, and a lower bound on the posterior variance. These bounds indicate that the posterior distribution of the horseshoe prior may be more informative than that of other one-component priors, including the Lasso.},

In response to this potential conflict, the members of the majority party endogenously choose a degree of control to grant to their leadership. The equilibrium level of party strength is decreasing in the size of the majority party and increasing in the strength of opposition among members of the minority party. The theory implies that the average performance of W-Nominate estimates of majority party members' ideal points will be a decreasing function of the size of the majority party while the performance of these estimates for members of the minority party will not be affected by the size of the majority party. Using data from the U.S. House and Senate between 1866 and 2004, the theory's predictions are largely consistent with roll-call voting in both chambers.},

  Abstract                 = {In this paper, I examine a simple procedure in the United States House of Represen- tatives, approving the Journal, and its implications for legislative business. In particular, following a suggestion made by Sinclair (1995), I examine the hypothesis that such votes are more than simply pro forma motions or dilatory tactics by the minority party. Rather, the taking of such a vote represents a signal (perhaps to members of the House, but at least to the analyst) that the dayÃ¢â¬â¢s ensuing business is important to at least one partyÃ¢â¬â¢s leadership and that it is expected to be a close vote. Considering the 102nd-107th Congresses, I show that a recorded vote on the SpeakerÃ¢â¬â¢s approval of the Journal indicates that the legislative dayÃ¢â¬â¢s business will be both more con- tentious (i.e., recorded votes have a smaller margin of passage) and more partisan (i.e., recorded votes are more likely to be Ã¢â¬Åparty unityÃ¢â¬ï¿½ votes). In addition, the Ã¯Â¬ï¿½t of PooleÃ¢â¬â¢s Op- timal ClassiÃ¯Â¬ï¿½cation estimates for legislatorsÃ¢â¬â¢ preferences is higher for recorded votes taken on such days. In addition, I discuss the marginal effect of the type and timing of legislative business on these Ã¯Â¬ï¿½ndings, as well as the identity of who calls for the vote on the Journal. Of particular interest are the differential effects for appropriations and Ã¢â¬ÅproceduralÃ¢â¬ï¿½ matters.},

These have been previously observed to have structure such as positive correlations between nearest-neighbour degrees. However, a detailed understanding of the origin of this phenomenon and the growth dynamics is lacking. Both of these are analyzed empirically and simulated using various models. A new one is presented, incorporating empirically necessary ingredients such as bipartiteness and sublinear preferential attachment. This, and a recently proposed model of team assembly both agree roughly with some empirical observations and fail in several others.},

  Abstract                 = {Using a Bayesian latent variable approach, we synthesize a new measure of democracy, the Unified Democracy Scores (UDS), from 10 extant scales. Our measure eschews the difficultâand often arbitraryâdecision to use one existing democracy scale over another in favor of a cumulative approach that allows us to simultaneously leverage the measurement efforts of numerous scholars. The result of this cumulative approach is a measure of democracy that, for every country-year, is at least as reliable as the most reliable component measure and is accompanied by quantitative estimates of uncertainty in the level of democracy. Moreover, for those who wish to continue using previously existing scales or to evaluate research performed using those scales, we extract information from the new measure to perform heretofore impossible direct comparisons between component scales. Specifically, we estimate the relative reliability of the constituent indicators, compare the specific ordinal levels of each of the existing measures in relationship to one another and assess overall levels of disagreement across raters. We make the UDS and associated parameter estimates freely available online and provide a detailed tutorial that demonstrates how to best use the UDS in applied work.},

  Abstract                 = {Summary.â Time series studies have provided strong evidence of an association between increased levels of ambient air pollution and increased hospitalizations, typically at a single lag of 0, 1 or 2 days after an air pollution episode. Two important scientific objectives are to understand better how the risk of hospitalization that is associated with a given day's air pollution increase is distributed over multiple days in the future and to estimate the cumulative short-term health effect of an air pollution episode over the same multiday period. We propose a Bayesian hierarchical distributed lag model that integrates information from national health and air pollution databases with prior beliefs of the time course of risk of hospitalization after an air pollution episode. This model is applied to air pollution and health data on 6.3 million enrollees of the US Medicare system living in 94 counties covering the years 1999â2002. We obtain estimates of the distributed lag functions relating fine particulate matter pollution to hospitalizations for both ischaemic heart disease and acute exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and we use our model to explore regional variation in the health risks across the USA.},

The chain of delegation assumes direct linkages between voters, parties and governments, of which the voters are the principal actor. When this assumption is tested for The Netherlands, it turns out that parties are not very responsive to voter priorities and that the policy distances between parliamentary parties and governments are relatively small. This pattern makes sense in a consensus democracy in which parties have to compromise and cannot afford simply to reflect what voters perceive as important. It also suggests that the mandate theory is more directly applicable to majoritarian democracies, where the winner takes all and therefore has more scope to translate voter priorities into policy-making.},

The spatial model also makes strong predictions about candidate positioning.

We develop a Ã¢â¬ËrevisedÃ¢â¬â¢ spatial model that incorporates non-policy factors, uncertainty, and policy- motivated candidates. We develop a structural approach to estimate both voter-specific and candidate-specific parameters using the Simulated Method of Moments. We use this approach to test the validity of the revised spatial model as an account of candidate positioning in U.S. Senate elections.

These theories are difficult to test because existing ideal point estimation techniques do not recover the locations of proposals or status quos. Instead, such techniques only recover cutpoints. This limitation has meant that existing tests of theories of lawmaking have been indirect in nature. I propose a method of directly measuring ideal points, proposal locations, and status quo locations on the same multidimensional scale, by employing a combination of voting data, bill and amendment cosponsorship data, and the congressional record. My approach works as follows. First, we can identify the locations of legislative proposals (bills and amendments) on the same scale as voter ideal points by jointly scaling voting and cosponsorship data. Next, we can identify the location of the final form of the bill using the location of last successful amendment (which we already know). If the bill was not amended, then the final form is simply the original bill location. Finally, we can identify the status quo point by employing the cutpoint we get form scaling the final passage vote. To implement this procedure, I automatically coded data on the congressional record available from www.thomas.gov. I apply this approach to recent sessions of the U.S. Senate, and use it to test the implications of competing theories of lawmaking.},

  Abstract                 = {This paper evaluates the âSecuring the Baseâ strategy, which has become widely accepted as the key to winning elections. This strategy, an alternative to the Swing Voter strategy, prescribes that candidates position themselves away from the political center in order to maximize turnout among their supporters and reduce defections of their supporters to third party candidates. If voter turnout depends on the positions that the candidates take, this may potentially lead to a situation where candidates may gain votes by moving away from the center. The presence of third party competition can have a similar effect. We evaluate the size of these effects using data for U.S. Presidential elections between 1976 and 2004. Our results weakly support abstention due to alienation, strongly support abstention due to indifference, and imply that candidate positioning has a large effect on voter turnout and third party voting. Nonetheless, our results indicate that the candidates can best compete by adopting centrist positions. While a candidate will gain some votes from moving away from the center due to increased turnout among his core supporters, many moderate voters will defect to his opponent.},

The size of government is smaller under a presidential regime. This last prediction is consistent with cross-country data.},

And do such electoral cycles differ among political systems? We investigate these questions in a data set encompassing sixty democracies from 1960-98. Without conditioning on the political system, we find that taxes are cut before elections, painful fiscal adjustments are postponed until after the elections, while welfare-state spending displays no electoral cycle. Our subsequent results show that the pre-election tax cuts is a universal phenomenon. The post-election fiscal adjustments (spending cuts, tax hikes and rises in surplus) are, however, only present in presidential democracies. Moreover, majoritarian electoral rules alone are associated with pre-electoral spending cuts, while proportional electoral rules are associated with expansions of welfare spending both before and after elections.},

  Abstract                 = {The authors of The Economic Effects of Constitutionsuse econometric tools to study what they call the "missing link" between constitutional systems and economic policy; the book is an uncompromisingly empirical sequel to their previous theoretical analysis of economic policy. Taking recent theoretical work as a point of departure, they ask which theoretical findings are supported and which are contradicted by the facts. The results are based on comparisons of political institutions across countries or time, in a large sample of contemporary democracies. They find that presidential/parliamentary and majoritarian/proportional dichotomies influence several economic variables: presidential regimes induce smaller public sectors, and proportional elections lead to greater and less targeted government spending and larger budget deficits. Moreover, the details of the electoral system (such as district magnitude and ballot structure) influence corruption and structural policies toward economic growth. Persson and Tabellini's goal is to draw conclusions about the causal effects of constitutions on policy outcomes. But since constitutions are not randomly assigned to countries, how the constitutional system was selected in the first place must be taken into account. This raises challenging methodological problems, which are addressed in the book. The study is therefore important not only in its findings but also in establishing a methodology for empirical analysis in the field of comparative politics.},

Playmate of the Year age, body feature measures, and facial feature measurements were correlated with a general measure of social and economic hard times. Consistent with Environmental Security Hypothesis predictions, when social and economic conditions were difficult, older, heavier, taller Playboy Playmates of the Year with larger waists, smaller eyes, larger waist-to-hip ratios, smaller bust-to-waist ratios, and smaller body mass index values were selected. These results suggest that environmental security may influence perceptions and preferences for women with certain body and facial features.},

Most of this literature, however, ignores international influences on the consolidation process. This lack investigation is especially troublesome given assertions by policymakers that outside assistance, including membership in international organizations, can support the consolidation process. I develop and test a theory of how membership in regional organizations can influence the process of democratic consolidation. I contend that regional IOs are not an outside entity forcing their preferences upon new democratic regimes, but that regional IOs are used by young democratic regimes to consolidate reforms through multiple causal mechanisms. I discuss both the demand for regional organizations as well as supply-side factors. I test the argument using event history analysis to analyze a sample of democracies from 1950 to 1992. I find that the joining of certain regional organizations is associated with increased longevity for new democracies.},

  Abstract                 = {There exist two rival frameworks to monetary theory: the Macroeconomic Approach and the Finance Approach. The Macroeconomic Approach emphasizes the medium of exchange role of money, whereas the Finance Approach emphasizes the store of value role. Historical evidence shows that the Macroeconomic Approach is unable to explain the behavior of an economy as it returns to a convertible money regime. Can the Finance Approach do better? This dissertation develops an analytical Finance Approach model of a convertible money regime. The lesson of the model is that the viability of a convertible money regime depends on the government's underlying fiscal policy. To test whether the Finance Approach has better explanatory power than the Macroeconomic Approach, this dissertation examines a significant period in the monetary history of the United States: the Greenback Era, defined as the period from the suspension of convertibility in December 1861 to the return of convertibility in January 1879. Before testing the two approaches, an accurate and complete description of events during the Greenback Era is provided. Existing literature on this period is inaccurate and outdated. This dissertation then tests whether the Finance Approach provides a better explanation than the Macroeconomic Approach for the behavior of the United States' economy on its return to convertibility. Up until now, the economics profession has explained the return convertibility solely in terms of the Macroeconomic Approach. This dissertation moves the profession forward by explaining the return to convertibility in terms of the Finance Approach, and argues that the Finance Approach provides the better explanation.},

  Abstract                 = {A new way to get the most out of world trade data produces the following results: - a graph of the world hierarchical structure, revealing the balance of strength among countries; - a clear-cut definition of Ã¢â¬ÅcoreÃ¢â¬ï¿½, Ã¢â¬ÅperipheryÃ¢â¬ï¿½, and Ã¢â¬Åsemi-peripheryÃ¢â¬ï¿½, much in line with World Systems orientation; - a conducive environment for further Ã¢â¬Åvalue chain analysesÃ¢â¬ï¿½; - the perspective of original policy tools. The simple methodology proposed in the paper establishes 16 different patterns of bilateral relationships between nations, ranging from full integration to dominance, in one direction, and to the absence of significant links, in another. The structural role of each country emerges from its relationships with all others, taken separately. The 16 patterns can be ranked worldwide, so as to give a metrics to the degree of hierarchy and Ã¢â¬ÅjusticeÃ¢â¬ï¿½ around the globe. In an initial application of the methodology, we describe how the world - interpreted as an oriented network - was structured in 1998 and 2003, pointing at some interesting structural dynamics.},

More specifically, we investigate how coup-proofing, that is, the strategies and tactics employed to prevent the military from seizing power, affects battlefield performance. The main argument claims that coup-proofing has a negative impact on soldiers’ leadership qualities, initiative, and the ability to coordinate different military units. Ultimately, the higher a country’s coup-proofing efforts relative to its opponent, the worse its effectiveness on the battlefield. We test this hypothesis using data on battlefield outcomes and coup-proofing between 1967 and 1999.},

Using Mankiw, Romer, and Weil's model of economic growth and data for roughly 80 countries, the authors show that political competition decreases the rate of physical capital accumulation and labor mobilization but increases the rate of human capital accumulation and (less conclusively) the rate of productivity change. The results suggest that political competition systematically affects the sources of growth, but those effects are cross-cutting, explainingwhy democracy itself may be ambiguous. These findingshelp clarify the debate about regime type and economic performance and suggest new avenues for research.},

  Abstract                 = {This monograph is one of a series produced as part of the RAND Cor- porationâs research project for the U.S. Department of Defense on how to improve U.S. counterinsurgency (COIN) capabilities. It should be of interest to persons in the government who are concerned with COIN issues and to scholars working in this field. The project will culminate in a report that builds on these earlier efforts. As of spring 2007, when field research for this monograph was completed, Iraq appeared to have slid from insurgency into civil war. The U.S. failure to focus on the protection of the Iraqi population in the preceding four years had contributed significantly to the subse- quent increase in insurgency and sectarian violence. In the security vacuum that ensued, Iraqi citizens were forced to engage in a Faus- tian bargainâoften looking to bad actors for protectionâin order to survive. The failure of the United States and the Iraqi government to subdue the Sunni insurgency and prevent terrorist actsâpunctuated by the 2006 destruction of the Golden Domeâproduced an escala- tion of Shiâa militancy and sectarian killing by both militia and police death squads. However, by early 2008, when this monograph was published, the security situation in Iraq had started to stabilize due to a number of factors: a Sunni reaction to al Qaeda excesses, a pullback of Shiâa mili- tias from anti-Sunni violence and confrontation with coalition forces, a decrease in externally supplied armaments, and strides made by U.S. and Iraqi forces in gaining control of important areas in the country, including western provinces such as Anbar and parts of Baghdad. It should be noted that as of this publication date, it is still not clear how the political-security situation in Iraq will eventually turn out. In par- ticular, the authors maintain considerable doubt as to whether Iraq can reconcile the divisions between the Sunni, Shiâa, and Kurdish elements of the population. Nevertheless, the reduced level of violence as of early 2008 was an encouraging development. That said, the authorsâ view is that our examination of U.S. politi- cal and military challenges in Iraq from 2003â2006 has important implications for improving future counterinsurgency strategy and capabilities. Iraq presents an example of a local political power struggle overlaid with sectarian violence and fueled by fanatical foreign jihad- ists and persistent criminal opportunistsâsome combination of forces likely to be replicated in insurgencies in other troubled states in the future. In that sense, this monograph highlights national capability gaps which persist despite the adoption and improved execution of counterinsurgency methods in Iraq.},

  Abstract                 = {The recent surge in studies analyzing spatial dependence in political science has gone hand in hand with increased attention paid to the choice of estimation technique. In comparison, specification choice has been relatively neglected, even though it leads to equally, if not more, serious inference problems. In this article we analyze four specification issues. We argue that to avoid biased estimates of the spatial effects, researchers need to consider carefully how to model temporal dynamics, common trends and common shocks, as well as how to account for spatial clustering and unobserved spatial heterogeneity. The remaining two specification issues relate to the weighting matrix employed for the creation of spatial effects: whether it should be row-standardized and what functional form to choose for this matrix. We demonstrate the importance of these specification issues by replicating Haysâs (2003, 2009) model of spatial dependence in international capital tax rate competition. Seemingly small changes to model specification have major impacts on the spatial effect estimates. We recommend that spatial analysts develop their theories of spatial dependencies further to provide more guidance on the specification of the estimation model. In the absence of sufficiently developed theories, the robustness of results to specification changes needs to be demonstrated.},

Trade volumes rose in five out of the nine wartime cases for which data are available. Further, I show that in the case of Nazi Germany increased trade was not a hindrance to, but rather a consequence of impending conflict.

I introduce a problem-solving framework to analyze sponsorship of black issue legislation from 1948 to 1997. The results show that black issue recognition has changed over time, but ideology, institutional position, and district composition are the core determinants of member decisions to recognize black issues. Rather than relying upon the outsider pressure of protest or the insider inÃÂ°uence of descriptive black representation, black Americans can expand the scope of conÃÂ°ict by simply electing white liberal representatives. Contrary to expectations of the exceptional quality of black agenda setting, in post-war America black politics is surprisingly normal.},

  Abstract                 = {Given the small number of bills that are actually enacted into public policy, it is puzzling that members continue to sponsor bills at such high rates. The conventional approach to this puzzle has been to either focus on the determinants of legislative effectiveness or to conceive of bill sponsorship as symbolic position-taking. As a result, we know relatively little about how sponsorship patterns vary across members and over time, and more importantly the introduc- tion of legislation has been divorced from the policy process. We address both of these problems by offering a Ã¢â¬Åproblem-solvingÃ¢â¬ï¿½ framework of bill sponsorship that is compatible with standard conceptions of goal-oriented behavior and conceives of sponsorship as placing issues onto the public agenda. Using multilevel linear models we analyze the issue content of membersÃ¢â¬â¢ legisla- tive portfolios from 1947 to 1998. We find that members adjust their sponsorship according to changing circumstances, whether those changes are in terms of their own institutional positions or broader developments in the social, political, and economic environments. Bill sponsorship is neither irrational nor devoid of policy relevance. It is a tool that members use to recognize problems and cultivate reputations as problem-solvers.},

  Abstract                 = {Lanchester's models of attrition describe casualty rates during battles between groups as functions of the numbers of individuals and their fighting abilities. Originally developed to describe human warfare, Lanchester's square law has been hypothesized to apply broadly to social animals as well, with important consequences for their aggressive behaviour and social structure. According to the square law, the fighting ability of a group is proportional to the square of the number of individuals, but rises only linearly with fighting ability of individuals within the group. By analyzing mortality rates of fire ants (Solenopsis invicta) fighting in different numerical ratios, we provide the first quantitative test of Lanchester's model for a non-human animal. Casualty rates of fire ants were not consistent with the square law; instead, group fighting ability was an approximately linear function of group size. This implies that the relative numbers of casualties incurred by two fighting groups are not strongly affected by relative group sizes and that battles do not disproportionately favour group size over individual prowess.},

  Abstract                 = {The American Civil War shaped the modern American state, but a how exactly did the se- cession crisis of 1861 become a major war? Stated differently, why did US President Abraham Lincoln eventually respond to Southern secession with military force? Existing explanations focus on imperfect information and audience costs. I argue that the American Civil War’s on- set can best be understood through preventive war logic: the North attacked to prevent British recognition of the South as an independent nation. Well into June 1861, Lincoln hoped a blockade would compel the Southern states to rejoin the Union without bloodshed. However, as the prospect of British recognition became more acute, Lincoln, believing a demonstration of force could prevent such recognition, chose to strike Southern forces at Manassas Junction, Virginia. The subsequent Northern defeat emboldened Southern military planners and ignited a long and bloody conflagration. Besides shedding light on this critical event, my exploration offers insight into how one can link the bargaining model of war to actual state decision mak- ing.},

A model is constructed in which importers are assumed to be rational utility maximizers who seek to satisfy international security as well as economic welfare objectives. This model of bilateral trade flows reflects contemporary theory in the field of international economics, and it explicitly incorporates the general foreign policy orientation of importers among its determinants. The model is tested in 16 annual cross-sectional estimations (1960-75) for a complete network of 25 countries. The findings show considerable support for the hypothesis that trade flows are significantly influenced by broad political relations of amity and enmity between nations. The author concludes that nations adjust trade ties to satisfy security as well as economic welfare goals and that a formal political economy of trade should reflect this fact.},

The model is consistent with neoclassical trade theory in economics, while employing data and measurement insights from the field of international relations to construct an indicator of bilateral diplomatic relations. The model is empirically tested using pooled, cross-section time-series analysis for six nations representing different worlds of development. Considerable empirical support is found for the model in general. The effects of diplomacy on commerce are significant and conform to model predictions in every instance. Estimation results also indicate possible cross-national differences in the political management of trade relations.},

  Abstract                 = {This paper argues that the half-Cauchy distribution should replace the inverse-Gamma distribution as a default prior for a top-level scale parameter in Bayesian hierarchical models, at least for cases where a proper prior is necessary. Our arguments involve a blend of Bayesian and frequentist reasoning, and are intended to complement the case made by Gelman (2006) in support of folded-t priors. First, we generalize the half-Cauchy prior to the wider class of hypergeometric inverted-beta priors. We derive expressions for posterior moments and marginal densities when these priors are used for a top-level normal variance in a Bayesian hierarchical model. We go on to prove a proposition that, together with the results for moments and marginals, allows us to characterize the frequentist risk of the Bayes estimators under all global-shrinkage priors in the class. These results, in turn, allow us to study the frequentist properties of the half-Cauchy prior versus a wide class of alternatives. The half-Cauchy occupies a sensible middle ground within this class: it performs well near the origin, but does not lead to drastic compromises in other parts of the parameter space. This provides an alternative, classical justification for the routine use of this prior. We also consider situations where the underlying mean vector is sparse, where we argue that the usual conjugate choice of an inverse-gamma prior is particularly inappropriate, and can severely distort inference. Finally, we summarize some open issues in the specification of default priors for scale terms in hierarchical models},

  Abstract                 = {This paper examines historical patterns of ROA (return on assets) for a cohort of 53,038 publicly traded firms across 93 countries, measured over the past 45 years. Our goal is to screen for firms whose ROA trajectories suggest that they have systematically outperformed their peer groups over time. Such a project faces at least three statistical difficulties: adjustment for relevant covariates, massive multiplicity, and longitudinal dependence. We conclude that, once these difficulties are taken into account, demonstrably superior performance appears to be quite rare. We compare our findings with other recent management studies on the same subject, and with the popular literature on corporate success. Our methodological contribution is to propose a new class of priors for use in large-scale simultaneous testing. These priors are based on the hypergeometric inverted-beta family, and have two main attractive features: heavy tails and computational tractability. The family is a four-parameter generalization of the normal/inverted-beta prior, and is the natural conjugate prior for shrinkage coefficients in a hierarchical normal model. Our results emphasize the usefulness of these heavy-tailed priors in large multiple-testing problems, as they have a mild rate of tail decay in the marginal likelihood m(y)—a property long recognized to be important in testing.},

This approach, which generalizes normal scale-mixture priors to an infinite-dimensional setting, has a number of connections with mathematical finance and Bayesian nonparametrics. We argue that it provides an intuitive framework for generating new regularization penalties and shrinkage rules; for performing asymptotic analysis on existing models; and for simplifying proofs of some classic results on normal scale mixtures.},

  Abstract                 = {This paper shows a general nonparametric unfolding technique for maximizing the correct classification of binary choice or two-category data. The motivation for and the primary focus of the unfolding technique are parliamentary roll call voting data. However, the procedures that implement the unfolding also can be applied to the problem of unfolding rank order data as well as analyzing a data set that would normally be the subject of a probit, logit, or linear probability analysis. One aspect of the scaling method greatly improves Manski's "maximum score estimator" technique for estimating limited dependent variable models. To unfold binary choice data two subproblems must be solved. First, given a set of chooser or legislator points, a cutting plane must be found such that it divides the legislators/choosers into two sets that reproduce the actual choices as closely as possible. Second, given a set of cutting planes for the binary choices, a point for each chooser or legislator must be found which reproduces the actual choices as closely as possible. Solutions for these two problems are shown in this paper. Monte Carlo tests of the procedure show it to be highly accurate in the presence of voting error and missing data.},

The scaling procedure performs, in effect, a singular value decomposition of a rectangular matrix of real elements with missing entries. In contrast to existing techniques such as factor analysis which work with a correlation or covariance matrix computed from the data matrix, the scaling procedure shown here analyzes the data matrix directly. The scaling procedure is a general-purpose tool that can be used not only to estimate latent/unobservable dimensions but also to estimate an Eckart-Young lower-rank approximation matrix of a matrix with missing entries. Monte Carlo tests show that the procedure reliably estimates the latent dimensions and reproduces the missing elements of a matrix even at high levels of error and missing data. A number of applications to political data are shown and discussed.},

We examine the community structure in these networks using several methods, revealing strong links between certain committees as well as an intrinsic hierarchical structure in the House as a whole. We identify structural changes, including additional hierarchical levels and higher modularity, resulting from the 1994 election, in which the Republican party earned majority status in the House for the first time in more than forty years. We also combine our network approach with analysis of roll call votes using singular value decomposition to uncover correlations between the political and organizational structure of House committees.},

  Abstract                 = {This paper explores the conditions under which cultural cleavages become politically salient. It does so by taking advantage of the natural experiment afforded by the division of the Chewa and Tumbuka peoples by the border between Zambia and Malawi. I document that, while the objective cultural differences between Chewas and Tumbukas on both sides of the border are identical, the political salience of the division between these communities is altogether different. I argue that this difference stems from the different sizes of the Chewa and Tumbuka communities in each country relative to each country's national political arena. In Malawi, Chewas and Tumbukas are each large groups vis-Ã -vis the country as a whole and, thus, serve as viable bases for political coalition-building. In Zambia, Chewas and Tumbukas are small relative to the country as a whole and, thus, not useful to mobilize as bases of political support. The analysis suggests that the political salience of a cultural cleavage depends not on the nature of the cleavage itself (since it is identical in both countries) but on the sizes of the groups it defines and whether or not they will be useful vehicles for political competition.},

Its defenders argue that the ICJ decides cases impartially. Its critics argue that the members of the ICJ vote the interests of the states that appoint them. Prior empirical scholarship is ambiguous. We test the charge of bias using statistical methods. We find strong evidence that (1) judges favor the states that appoint them and that (2) judges favor states whose wealth level is close to that of the their own states, and weaker evidence that (3) judges favor states whose political system is similar to that of their own states and that (4) (more weakly) judges favor states whose culture (language and religion) is similar to that of their own states.

However, other than a few case studies, there exists no direct and systematic evidence that issue linkages actually increase the probability of states reaching agreement. I address this lack of direct and sys- tematic evidence in three steps. First, drawing from original data on failed military alliance negotiations and from the Alliance Treaty Obligations and Provisions (ATOP) database, I cre- ate a dataset of military alliance negotiations involving at least one European state from 1815 to 1945. Second, using matching techniques, I find that, from 1860 to 1913 and from 1919 to 1939, trade linkage offers increased the probability of agreement during alliance negotiations. Third, a series of sensitivity analysis tests that show these results are robust to omitted vari- able bias, varying the time period under consideration, and the possibility of missing data on linkage offers.},

  Abstract                 = {Since the 1990s, the IMF has been persuading emerging market countries to avoid restrictions on their capital accounts to improve economic efficiency. As a result, some countries that pursued liberalization have faced huge currency crises due to premature liberalization. Some economists expect that imposing capital restrictions could create bad economic fundamentals: i.e., misallocating financial resources, which would eventually lead an economy to crisis. Some recent empirical analyses, however, have found that capital controls are positively associated with currency crises. Some other studies find no significant relationship. These mixed empirical results could be the result of applying blunt capital restriction measurements, especially ones that do not allow for different degrees of controls. These studies also do not distinguish between controls on inflows and outflows although many economists expect these to have different effects. This dissertation creates measures of capital controls by increasing the disaggregation and intensity of capital control indices, and measuring separately the controls on capital inflows from capital restrictions on outflows. This makes use of the newly improved information about capital transactions from the IMFÃ¢â¬â¢s AREAER started in 1996. The data of this study spans the period from 1995 to 2004, covering 26 emerging markets around the world. The analyses of the association between currency crises and capital restrictions in this dissertation find that imposing controls on capital inflows (outflows) is more likely to reduce (increase) the vulnerability to currency crises, using Exchange Market Pressure Indices (EMPI) as proxies for currency crises. Due to a high correlation between the inflow and outflow capital control measures, the joint confidence ellipsoid (region) technique is used. This technique confirms that these capital controls have significantly different influences on currency crises. The analyses use various currency crises measures (dummy and continuous variables), various types of capital transactions restrictions, and compare these results against the capital control indices of well-known studies.},

  Abstract                 = {How much should a defender spend on defense rather than something else like health care, education, or other social purposes? And how should a defender allocate however much it decides to spend across the multiple sites it is trying to protect? This paper characterizes the generically unique equlibrum outcome of a sequential game in which a defender ï¬rst has to decide how much to spend on defense and what to spend it on. The more that a defender dedicates to hardening or protecting a speciï¬c site, the less likely an attack on that site is to succeed. After the defender moves, the attacker, e.g., a terrorist group, chooses how much eï¬ort or resources to devote to attacking the defender and how to allocate that eï¬ort to the various sites. The more eï¬ort the attacker devotes to any given site, the more likely the attack on that site is to succeed. The analysis shows that (i) the marginal eï¬ect of spending on the defenderâs payoï¬ can be decomposed into the sum of a defensive eï¬ect, a deterrent eï¬ect, and a cost eï¬ect; (ii) the defenderâs allocation and level-of-spending problems are separable in that regardless of how much the defender decides to spend, it allocates that amount in the same general way; (iii) the optimal (equilibrium) allocation of the defenderâs resources minmaxes the attacker; (iv) the defenderâs equilibrium level of spending minimizes a simple loss function; and (v) facing a more determined attacker has no eï¬ect on the allocations of spending and eï¬ort, but does lead to greater levels of spending and eï¬ort.},

  Abstract                 = {This paper develops a framework for analyzing a defender's allocation of scarce resources against a strategic adversary like a terrorist group in four settings: (1) a baseline case in which the sites the defender tries to guard are "independent" in that resources dedicated to protecting one site have no effect on any other site; (2) if the defender can also allocate resources to border defense, intelligence, or counterterrorist operations which, if successful, protect all of the sites; (3) if threats have strategic and nonstrategic components (e.g., the threat to public health from bioterror attacks and the natural outbreak of new diseases); and (4) if the defender is unsure of the terrorists' preferred targets. The analysis characterizes the defender's optimal (equilibrium) allocations in these settings, an algorithm or approach to finding the optimal allocations, and relevant comparative statics. These characterizations provide a general way of thinking about the resource-allocation problem in these settings.},

  Abstract                 = { Although formal work on war generally sees war as a kind of bargaining breakdown resulting from asymmetric information, bargaining indivisibilities, or commitment problems, most analyses have focused on informational issues. But informational explanations and the models underlying them have at least two major limitations: they often provide a poor account of prolonged conflict, and they give an odd reading of the history of some cases. This article describes these limitations and argues that bargaining indivisibilities should really be seen as commitment problems. The present analysis then shows that a common mechanism links three important kinds of commitment problem: (1) preventive war, (2) preemptive attacks arising from first-strike or offensive advantages, and (3) conflicts resulting from bargaining over issues that affect future bargaining power. In each case, large, rapid shifts in the distribution of power can lead to war. Finally, the analysis elaborates a distinctly different mechanism based on a comparison of the cost of deterring an attack on the status quo with the expected cost of trying to eliminate the threat to the status quo.},

  Abstract                 = {Much of the existing formal work on war models the decision to go to war as a game-ending, costly lottery. This article relaxes this assumption by treating war as a costly process during which the states run the risk of military collapse. The model also allows for uncertainty over either the cost of fighting or the distribution of power. The analysis makes four contributions to the growing costly-process literature: (i) the present model provides a more general treatment of the learning process that occurs when states are uncertain about the distribution of power, (ii) it explicitly compares the bargaining and learning processes for the two different sources of uncertainty, (iii) it suggests a way to empirically distinguish wars arising from these two sources, and (iv) it shows that the equilibrium dynamics of informational accounts of war may be quite sensitive to the underlying bargaining environment through which information is conveyed.},

  Abstract                 = {Robert Powell argues persuasively and elegantly for the usefulness of formal models in studying international conflict and for the necessity of greater dialogue between modeling and empirical analysis. Powell makes it clear that many widely made arguments about the way states act under threat do not hold when subjected to the rigors of modeling. In doing so, he provides a more secure foundation for the future of international relations theory. Powell argues that, in the Hobbesian environment in which states exist, a state can respond to a threat in at least three ways: (1) it can reallocate resources already under its control; (2) it can try to defuse the threat through bargaining and compromise; (3) it can try to draw on the resources of other states by allying with them. Powell carefully outlines these three responses and uses a series of game theoretic models to examine each of them, showing that the models make the analysis of these responses more precise than would otherwise be possible. The advantages of the modeling-oriented approach, Powell contends, have been evident in the number of new insights they have made possible in international relations theory. Some argue that these advances could have originated in ordinary-language models, but as Powell notes, they did not in practice do so. The book focuses on the insights and intuitions that emerge during modeling, rather than on technical analysis, making it accessible to readers with only a general background in international relations theory.},

  Abstract                 = {Although incomplete information is recognized to be an essential feature of crises, game-theoretic formulations have not generally modeled this explicitly. This paper models a mutually assured destruction (MAD) crisis as a game of sequential bargaining with incomplete information, sufficiently simple that its equibria may be found. These provide better game-theoretic foundations for the notions of resolve and critical risk and their role in crises and also make it possible to compare the bargaining dynamics of this model with those of descriptively richer, but incompletely specified models, revealing several inconsistencies: several analyses of MAD conclude that the state with the greatest resolve in this contest of resolve will prevail. Many models based on critical risks suggest that a state is less likely to escalate, the greater its adversary's resolve. In our model, however, the state with the weakest resolve sometimes prevails, and some states prove more likely to escalate if their adversaries' resolve is greater.},

  Abstract                 = {The salience of judicial appointments in contemporary American politics has precipitated a surge of scholarly interest in the dynamics of advice and consent in the U.S. Senate. In this article, we compare alternative pivotal politics models of the judicial nominations process, each capturing a different set of potential veto players in the Senate. We use these spatial models to guide empirical analysis of rejection patterns in confirmation contests for the lower federal courts. Using data on the outcomes of all nominations to the U.S. Courts of Appeals and the U.S. District Courts between 1975 and 2006, we show that models incorporating the preferences of the majority party median and the filibuster pivots best account for confirmation patterns we observe at the appellate and trial court levels, while advice and consent for trial courts has more recently been influenced by home-state senators.},

  Abstract                 = {?Strong? political parties within legislatures are often thought to be one solution to the problem of inefficient universalism, a norm under which all legislators seek large projects for their districts that are paid for out of a common pool. We use a noncooperative framework to demonstrate that, even if parties have no role in the legislature, their role in elections can be sufficient to reduce the demand for pork-barrel spending and, in the process, reduce total spending. Specifically, we argue that if parties in the electorate are strong, then legislators will have less demand for pork because of a decreased incentive to secure the ?personal vote? via inefficient pork-barrel spending. In a model with both public goods and local distributive goods (pork), we show that legislators in strong party environments will demand less pork and more public goods, leading to lower and more efficient spending in total. We then establish empirically that spending in states with strong party organizations is smaller than in states where parties are weak.},

  Abstract                 = {It has been argued that antidumping (AD) facilitates trade liberalization by serving as a release valve for protectionist pressure. We focus on a group of prominent ADusing developing countries and examine the validity of the pressure release hypothesis. The fact that these new AD users generally began using AD after significant trade liberalization supports the hypothesis. Yet, if pressure exists to reverse liberalization, it is not because products that were subject to AD scrutiny were treated poorly in the liberalization programme. For nearly all major new users products subject to AD investigations do not have unusually low tariffs nor have they experienced unusually large tariff reductions. Our main point is that that AD is not the only policy option. For all countries studied the tariff bindings are weak in the sense that the bound levels exceed the applied levels by a considerable margin. Because of this, developing countries can raise their applied tariffs without running afoul of WTO rules. This is not just a theoretical possibility â we show that for some countries 8 out of 10 HS6 tariffs have been increased in recent years. Countries could certainly increase applied rates for industries that are particularly susceptible to injury from trade. By doing so ADâs vague and economically illogical rules could be reformed without placing other WTO trade liberalization initiatives at risk. The reality is, however, that industries prefer AD because AD duties are often far larger than the bound rates. With the cumulation provision industries can effectively use AD protection against all major import sources. Because AD is not needed as pressure release valve and because it involves high duties against most import sources, AD is likely more damaging to the world trading system than the pressure release valve hypothesis suggests.},

  Abstract                 = {What makes political regimes rise, endure, and fall? The main question is whether the observed close relation between levels of economic development and the incidence of democratic regimes is due to democracies being more likely to emerge or only more likely to survive in the more developed countries. We answer this question using data concerning 135 countries that existed at any time between 1950 and 1990. We find that the level of economic development does not affect the probability of transitions to democracy but that affluence does make democratic regimes more stable. The relation between affluence and democratic stability is monotonic, and the breakdown of democracies at middle levels of development is a phenomenon peculiar to the Southern Cone of Latin America. These patterns also appear to have been true of the earlier period, but dictatorships are more likely to survive in wealthy countries that became independent only after 1950. We conclude that modernization need not generate democracy but democracies survive in countries that are modern.},

This is the theory of @'structural dependence of the state on capital.@' Using a formal model, the internal logic and the robustness of the theory is examined. We conclude that in a static sense the theory is false: virtually any distribution of consumption between wage earners and owners of capital is compatible with continual private investment once an appropriate set of taxes and transfers is in place. Yet the state may be structurally dependent in a dynamic sense. Policies that, once in place, redistribute income without reducing investment do reduce investment during the period in which they are anticipated but not yet implemented.},

Hierarchical priors are developed and, as the resulting posterior probability distributions and Bayesian estimators do not admit closed-form analytical expressions, reversible jump Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods are derived to estimate these quantities. Results are obtained for standard denoising and segmentation of speech data problems that have already been examined in the literature. These results demonstrate the performance of our methods},

Using illustrations from Western economic summitry, the Panama Canal and Versailles Treaty negotiations, IMF stabilization programs, the European Community, and many other diplomatic contexts, this article offers a theory of ratification. It addresses the role of domestic preferences and coalitions, domestic political institutions and practices, the strategies and tactics of negotiators, uncertainty, the domestic reverberation of international pressures, and the interests of the chief negotiator. This theory of \&quot;two-level games\&quot; may also be applicable to many other political phenomena, such as dependency, legislative committees, and multiparty coalitions.},

The associations between change in international financial regulation and measures of long-run economic growth, corporate taxation, government expenditures, and income inequality are estimated, using the models, methods, and data of Barro (1991), Deininger and Squire (1996a), Leamer (1983, 1985), and Levine and Renelt (1992). The findings point to a new agenda for research on international financial regulation.},

  Abstract                 = {Many situations exist in which a latent construct has both ordinal and continuous indicators. This presents a problem for the applied researcher because standard measurement models are not designed to accommodate mixed ordinal and continuous data. I address this problem by formulating a measurement model that is appropriate for such mixed multivariate responses. This model unifies standard normal theory factor analysis and item response theory models for ordinal data. I detail a Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithm for model fitting. I apply the model to cross-national data on political-economic risk and find that the model works well. Software for fitting this model is publicly available in the MCMCpack (Martin and Quinn 2004, "MCMCpack 0.4-8") R package.},

  Abstract                 = {We contrast social-structural theories of voting behavior with spatial theories of voting behavior to explain voter choice in the Netherlands and Great Britain. We hypothesize that voting behavior is best explained by the spatial theory of voting. Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) simulation is used to estimate multinomial probit (MNP) and multinomial logit (MNL) models of voter choice, for which we calculate Bayes factors for the purpose of model comparison. We find that the joint social-structural/spatial model is the best explanatory model in the Netherlands. Our results indicate that the MNP model outperforms the MNL model in our Dutch sample. In Great Britain, on the other hand, a purely spatial model is the best explanatory model, and our MNL model outperforms our MNP model. These results suggest the question of whether to employ MNL or MNP depends crucially on the data at hand.},

  Abstract                 = {We describe a method for statistical learning from speech documents that we apply to the Congressional Record in order to gain new insight into the dynamics of the political agenda. Prior efforts to evaluate the attention of elected representatives across topic areas have largely been expensive manual coding exercises and are generally circumscribed along one or more features of detail: limited time periods, high levels of temporal aggregation, and coarse topical categories. Conversely, the Congressional Record has scarcely been used for such analyses, largely because it contains too much information to absorb manually. We describe here a method for inferring, through the patterns of word choice in each speech and the dynamics of word choice patterns across time, (a) what the topics of speeches are, and (b) the probability that attention will be paid to any given topic or set of topics over time. We use the model to examine the agenda in the United States Senate from 1997-2004, based on a new database of over 70 thousand speech documents containing over 70 million words. We estimate the model for 42 topics and provide evidence that we can reveal speech topics that are both distinctive and inter-related in substantively meaningful ways. We demonstrate further that the dynamics our model gives us leverage into important questions about the dynamics of the political agenda.},

(1996); Ishwaran and Zarepour (2000); Ishwaran and James (2001) and Ishwaran and Zarepour (2002), on semiparametric Bayesian methods, we develop Bayesian inference for a particular class of semiparametric strategic choice models. Unlike previous approaches that have assumed the disturbances entering into actorsâ random utility functions follow a particular, known distribution such as a Gaussian distribution or a type I extreme value distribution, we instead assume only that the differenced disturbances have a right-continuous distribution function with fixed median and interquartile range. We model such a random distribution function using an approximation to the centrally standardized Dirichlet process prior of Newton et al. (1996). Model fitting is accomplished via Markov chain Monte Carlo. We present results from Monte Carlo experiments and a simulated data example. Our Monte Carlo results show that incorrectly specifying the distribution of the actorsâ utility disturbances within a parametric model can dramatrically bias quantities of interest such as the conditional expectation function and fitted probabilities. Our simulated data example demonstrates that our semiparametric approach works well on a difficult example in which the underlying true distribution function of the differenced disturbances is highly skewed.},

In the current version, the dataset covers 50 unstable countries from 1997 through 2010. ACLED's disaggregation of civil war and transnational violent events allow for research on local level factors and the dynamics of civil and communal conflict. Findings from subnational conflict research challenges conclusions from larger national-level studies. In a brief descriptive analysis, the authors find that, on average, conflict covers 15\% of a state's territory, but almost half of a state can be directly affected by internal wars.},

  Abstract                 = {Theories of parties and lawmaking typically require measures of legislators' preferences for empirical analysis (e.g., Aldrich and Rohde 1998, 2000; Cox and McCubbins 2005; Krehbiel 1998). However, existing methods for generating estimates of these preferences presume that legislators care only about their own policy preferences and not about their constituency or party line (Poole and Rosenthal 1997; Clinton, Jackman, and Rivers 2004), though substantive scholars have for decades hypothesized otherwise (e.g., Fenno 1973; Clausen 1973; Sinclair 1995; Smith 2007). To this end, I develop a new statistical estimator to determine the weights legislators place on their preferences, party, and constituency in roll call voting. Estimation is performed within a Maximum Likelihood framework via the "zig-zag" technique of Heckman and Macurdy (1980; see also Poole and Rosenthal 1997). The results help to explain the gap between estimated ideal points and legislators' true preferences and, thereby, have important implications for lawmaking theories, as well as theories of representation.},

  Abstract                 = {I analyze the voting behavior of legislators in the Congresses of the Confed- erate States of America during the American Civil War. I show that the occupation of Confederate Congressional districts by Federal troops led leg- islators to abandon their previous voting behavior and instead support the strengthening of the central government in Richmond. Specific case evidence involving voting on habeus corpus is provided to further demonstrate the ro- bustness of this result. Most important, the result leads to outcomes at odds with the logic of secession as enunciated by Southern elites.},

Leaders vary according to their competence, which allows leaders to maintain rallies for war, and to alter prior support using a domestic policy. Analysis of the model shows how the weakness of the opposition is necessary to allow for diversionary wars, and how the nature of a diversionary war is shaped by the degree to which competence is revealed in domestic policy, and not the competence of the leader, nor the strength of the opposition},

We develop a sequential segmentation spline method that can identify both the location and the number of discontinuities in a series of observations with a time component, while fitting a smooth spline between jumps, using a modified Bayesian Information Criterion statistic as a stopping rule. We explore the method in a large-n, unbalanced panel setting with George W. Bush's approval data, a small-n time series with median DW-NOMINATE scores for each Congress over time, and a series of simulations. We compare the method to several extant smoothers, and the method performs favorably in terms of visual inspection, residual properties, and event detection. Finally, we discuss extensions of the method.},

  Abstract                 = {Why do states realign their foreign policies? I argue that democratic transitions are an important cause of foreign-policy realignment with the United States and, furthermore, that the nature of that realignment is conditioned by whether the United States supported the previous nondemocratic regime. American support, or lack thereof, for the ancien rÃÂ©gime structures the domestic politics of democratic transitions. In the absence of previous U.S. support, democratization commonly leads to positive foreign-policy realignment toward the United States. Conversely, when the United States supports nondemocratic regimes, democratic transitions rarely produce positive realignment. I use an original data set of countryÃ¢ÂÂ year dyads with the United States from 1950 to 2000. Using Markov Transition regression models, I find that the interaction of democratic transition and previous U.S. support is a powerful determinant of foreign-policy realignment. This research has important implications for international relations theory and American foreign policy.},

Either informed insiders signal project quality by hiring an expensive star, or stars capture their expected economic rent. These approaches are tested on a sample of movies produced in the 1990s. Means comparisons suggest that star-studded films bring in higher revenues. However, regressions show that any big budget investment increases revenues. Sequels, highly visible films and "family oriented" ratings also contribute to revenues. A higher return on investment is correlated only with G or PG ratings and marginally with sequels. This is consistent with the "rent capture" hypothesis.},

  Abstract                 = {This paper aims to show to practitioners how flexible and straightforward the implementation of the Bayesian paradigm can be for distributed lag models within the Bayesian dynamic linear model framework.Distributed lag models are of importance when it is believed that a covariate at time t, say Xt, causes an impact on the mean value of the response variable, Yt. Moreover, it is believed that the effect of X on Y persists for a period and decays to zero as time passes by. There are in the literature many different models that deal with this kind of situation. This paper aims to review some of these proposals and show that under some fairly simple reparametrization they fall into a particular case of a class of Dynamic Linear Models (DLM), the transfer functions models. Inference is performed following the Bayesian paradigm. Samples from the joint posterior distribution of the unknown quantities of interest are easily obtained through the use of Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods. The computation is simplified by the use of the software WinBugs.As an example, a consumption function is analysed using the Koyck transformation and the transfer function models. Then a comparison is made with classical cointegration techniques. Copyright Â© 2006 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.},

  Abstract                 = { It is often asserted that democratic states never fight wars against each other, but there is a rather lengthy list of exceptions to that rule that are consistently or prominently mentioned in the literature on the democratic peace phenomenon. The controversy regarding whether democratic states never, or only rarely fight wears against each other is unlikely to move in the direction of satisfactory resolution unless an attempt is made to evaluate controversial cases based on a threshold of democracy that is simple, operational, theoretically informed, and intuitively appealing. If a political regime is categorized as democratic only if the identities of the leaders of its executive branch and the members of its national legislature are determined in elections in which at least two independent political parties participate, in which at least half the adult population are eligible to vote, and if the fairness of elections has been established by at least one peaceful transfer of power between opposing political parties, then an examination of controversial cases reveals that the proposition that democratic states never fight wars against each other is defensible. },

  Abstract                 = {When a state in a diplomatic crisis with a rival mobilizes its military, it pays in advance some of the costs of fighting a war, since military movements are a necessary precondition to fighting. Sinking costs into war during negotiation alters the bargaining environment. This is because the set of possible negotiated outcomes mutually-preferred to war is determined by the joint costs of war, and part of the cost of war is military mobilization. Mobilization sinks some of those costs for the mobilizing state, reducing the remaining marginal costs of war, thereby reducing the set of possible negotiated settlements. A state that mobilizes its military will need a larger negotiated concession from a rival in order to induce it not to fight. With imperfect information, the cost- sinking effects of mobilization can cancel out any informational benefits that mobilization may have as a way of signaling resolve. The probability of bargaining breakdown and war can be influenced by the relative value of mobilization and fighting costs, but the direction of the effect is sensitive to different assumptions.},

  Abstract                 = {Ultimatum bargaining models of international interactions suggest that when conflict is costly and the actors are fully informed, the probability of conflict goes to zero. However, conflict occurs with some positive probability when the challenger is uncertain about the defender's reservation value. I employ a simple ultimatum game of bargaining to evaluate two traditional power-centric theories of world politics, balance of power, and power transition theory. The formal and empirical analyses demonstrate that as states approach power parity, information asymmetries are greatest, thus enhancing the probability of militarized conflict. Uncertainty is a central cause of conflict emergence and is correlated with the distribution of observable capabilities. Recognizing the relationship between the distribution of power and the uncertainty offers a more sophisticated interpretation of power-centric explanations of world politics.},

  Abstract                 = {ABSTRACT Existing research on power and war contends that the distribution of power exerts an independent effect on the chances of armed conflict. However, theories of bargaining indicate that power's influence on war depends on the ex ante distribution of benefits and has a specific functional form. We test that claim, showing that the effect of power on war rests heavily on the distribution of benefits. Our findings strongly suggest bargaining explanations may subsume other arguments about power and war both theoretically and empirically.},

Although the Political Regime Change dataset is comparable to existing datasets that measure institutional and political characteristics, its use of a broader set of indicators and categories by which to classify regimes creates important differences. The importance of this broader classification scheme becomes increasingly apparent in many &#039;third wave&#039; transitions, where semi-democracies have been a common outcome of regime change.},

The distribution of user activity is investigated and a network of bidders connected by common interest in individual articles is constructed. The network's cluster structure corresponds to the main user groups according to common interest, exhibiting hierarchy and overlap. Key feature of the analysis is its independence of any similarity measure between the articles offered on eBay, as such a measure would only introduce bias in the analysis. Results are compared to null models based on random networks and clusters are validated and interpreted using the taxonomic classifications of eBay categories. We find clear-cut and coherent interest profiles for the bidders in each cluster. The interest profiles of bidder groups are compared to the classification of articles actually bought by these users during the time span 6-9 months after the initial grouping. The interest profiles discovered remain stable, indicating typical interest profiles in society. Our results show how network theory can be applied successfully to problems of market segmentation and sociological milieu studies with sparse, high dimensional data.},

Defendants concede more prior to GATT judgments than afterward, despite GATT's lack of enforcement power. Yet, why would states plea-bargain if they know they can spurn contrary rulings? To find out, the article develops an incomplete information model of trade bargaining with the option of adjudication. The plaintiff has greater resolve prior to a ruling, believing that the defendant might be compelled to concede to an adverse judgment-even if that belief later proves false. Surprisingly, this resolve induces more generous settlements even from defendants who intend not to comply with any ruling. Alter a ruling, however, this anticipatory effect is irrelevant: adjudication works best when threatened but not realized. The prospect of adjudication thus conditions the behavior of states even when enforcement is not forthcoming but not through mechanisms identified by previous studies.},

Existing studies suggest that democracies should either experience and litigate fewer trade conflicts or at least resolve them more cooperatively. Other works contend that improvements in the trade dispute settlement regime account for the rising number of trade complaints in recent years. This paper provides the first large-scale test of these hypotheses and others, using multivariate regression and exhaustive new data on dispute initiation within all GATT/WTO directed dyads from 1948 through 1998. The evidence contradicts prevailing explanations. It turns out that democracies participate in more, not fewer, GATT/WTO disputes, and they resolve those disputes less cooperatively as well. Moreover, changes in the dispute settlement regime have not had the predicted impact.},

  Abstract                 = {This article presents and tests a theory of learning in international politics. Drawing primarily from social psychology and organization theory, the learning theory proposes that lessons tend to be drawn only from high-impact events in world politics, such as large wars and economic depressions. Lessons drawn tend to be simple and are oriented around the question of which policies are likely to be successful and which policies are likely to fail. This learning theory is tested on the alliance choices of small powers in the twentieth century. The predictions of two learning hypotheses are compared with those of a leading realist explanation of alliance choices, balance of threat theory. Quantitative analysis of small powers' alliance choices reveals that a small power's experience in the previous world war is a very powerful explanation of its peacetime alliance choices after that war, whereas the level of threat in the international environment has only marginal effects on the small power's alliance choices. Further, these threat effects may be in the opposite direction of that predicted by balance of threat theory.},

Several foreign policy theories make predictions as to what military strategies a state will choose. This article presents the first quantitative, empirical tests of hypotheses of strategy choice. Analysis was conducted on a random sample of country-years taken from the population of all countries from the years 1903 to 1994. Military strategy is classified as being either maneuver, attrition, or punishment. Empirical findings reveal that democracies and industrialized states are more likely to choose maneuver strategies, and that a state's own experiences affect the likelihood of it choosing maneuver. Factors found not to affect strategy choice include terrain, the level of external threat, troop quality, whether a state is democratizing, whether a state is a mixed regime, whether a state is a military regime, and vicarious experiences.},

  Abstract                 = {Why do democracies win the wars they fight? The authors explore this question by examining whether the armies of democratic states fight with higher military effectiveness on the battlefield, testing two general propositions: that the higher legitimacy of democratic states spurs superior individual soldiering and that democratic militaries are likely to have higher organizational efficacy. The authors test their propositions on a comprehensive set of major battles from 1800 to 1982, using data compiled by the Historical Evaluation and Research Organization. The authors find that the armies of democratic states tend to fight with marginally better logistics, substantially better initiative, and superior leadership. They also find that all three of these advantages dwindle as wars lengthen and interpret the results as indicating that although soldiers are not more willing to die for democratic governments, the emphasis on individual initiative in democratic culture generates important advantages on the battlefield.},

  Abstract                 = {Why do democracies win wars? This is a critical question in the study of international relations, as a traditional view--expressed most famously by Alexis de Tocqueville--has been that democracies are inferior in crafting foreign policy and fighting wars. In Democracies at War, the first major study of its kind, Dan Reiter and Allan Stam come to a very different conclusion. Democracies tend to win the wars they fight--specifically, about eighty percent of the time. Complementing their wide-ranging case-study analysis, the authors apply innovative statistical tests and new hypotheses. In unusually clear prose, they pinpoint two reasons for democracies' success at war. First, as elected leaders understand that losing a war can spell domestic political backlash, democracies start only those wars they are likely to win. Secondly, the emphasis on individuality within democratic societies means that their soldiers fight with greater initiative and superior leadership. Surprisingly, Reiter and Stam find that it is neither economic muscle nor bandwagoning between democratic powers that enables democracies to win wars. They also show that, given societal consent, democracies are willing to initiate wars of empire or genocide. On the whole, they find, democracies' dependence on public consent makes for more, rather than less, effective foreign policy. Taking a fresh approach to a question that has long merited such a study, this book yields crucial insights on security policy, the causes of war, and the interplay between domestic politics and international relations.},

  Abstract                 = {How do nation-states' political institutions affect the relations between states? This article addresses that question by testing the predictions of different theories linking political institutions to war outcomes. Specifically, rent-seeking and regime legitimacy theories predict that all democratic belligerents are more likely to win wars because they fight more effectively. Alternatively, other theories focusing on the domestic political vulnerability of leaders and the marketplace of ideas predict that democracies are likely to be more careful about choosing when to start war. This would mean that only democratic initiators are more likely to win. Analyzing all interstate wars from 1816 to 1982 with a multivariate probit model, we find that democratic initiators are significantly more likely to win wars; democratic targets are also more likely to win, though the relationship is not as strong. We also find empirical support for several control variables, including strategy, terrain, and capability.},

  Abstract                 = {Movements in the stock market can have a significant impact on the macroeconomy and are therefore likely to be an important factor in the determination of monetary policy. However, little is known about the magnitude of the Federal Reserve's reaction to the stock market. One reason is that it is difficult to estimate the policy reaction because of the simultaneous response of equity prices to interest rate changes. This paper uses an identification technique based on the heteroskedasticity of stock market returns to identify the reaction of monetary policy to the stock market. The results indicate that monetary policy reacts significantly to stock market movements, with a 5% rise (fall) in the S&P 500 index increasing the likelihood of a 25 basis point tightening (easing) by about a half. This reaction is roughly of the magnitude that would be expected from estimates of the impact of stock market movements on aggregate demand. Thus, it appears that the Federal Reserve systematically responds to stock price movements only to the extent warranted by their impact on the macroeconomy.},

  Abstract                 = {Estimating the response of asset prices to changes in monetary policy is complicated by the endogeneity of policy decisions and the fact that both interest rates and asset prices react to numerous other variables. This paper develops a new estimator that is based on the heteroskedasticity that exists in high frequency data. We show that the response of asset prices to changes in monetary policy can be identified based on the increase in the variance of policy shocks that occurs on days of FOMC meetings and of the Chairman's semi-annual monetary policy testimony to Congress. The identification approach employed requires a much weaker set of assumptions than needed under the 'event-study' approach that is typically used in this context. The results indicate that an increase in short-term interest rates results in a decline in stock prices and in an upward shift in the yield curve that becomes smaller at longer maturities. The findings also suggest that the event-study estimates contain biases that make the estimated effects on stock prices appear too small and those on Treasury yields too large.},

  Abstract                 = {Science involves the accumulation of knowledge, which means not only the formulation of new sentences about discoveries but also the reformulation of empirically falsified or theoretically discredited old sentences. Science has therefore a history that is mainly a chronicle and interpretation of a series of reformulations. It is often asserted that political science has no history. Although this assertion is perhaps motivated by a desire to identify politics with belles lettres, it may also have a reasonable foundation, in that political institutions may change faster than knowledge can be accumulated. To investigate whether propositions about evanescent institutions can be scientifically falsified and reformulated, I examine in this essay the history of the recent and not wholly accepted revisions of the propositions collectively called Duverger's law: that the plurality rule for selecting the winner of elections favors the two-party system. The body of the essay presents the discovery, revision, testing, and reformulation of sentences in this series in order to demonstrate that in at least one instance in political science, knowledge has been accumulated and a history exists.},

  Abstract                 = {It is easy to blame the violence in Iraq and the pitfalls of the war on terror on a small cabal of neocons, a bumbling president, and an overstretched military. But real fault lies with the American people as well. There is an uncomplicated tale many Americans like to tell themselves about recent US foreign policy. Since at least the election of Ronald Reagan in 1980, a political philosophy known as neoliberalism has dominated the American political landscape. This neoliberal philosophy is built on a bedrock of skepticism about the role of central government and the effectiveness of grand governmental projects. Conservatives often countered that one consequence of the war on terror has been a complete loss of budgetary discipline in Washington. Civil libertarians certainly think Americans have paid a large if intangible price in the rollback of their civil liberties. The desires and preferences of the American people have shaped the war on terror just as profoundly as any neoconservative doctrine on the conduct of US foreign policy.},

  Abstract                 = {Little is known about how to generate plausible new scientific ideas. So it is noteworthy that 12 years of self-experimentation led to the discovery of several surprising cause-effect relationships and suggested a new theory of weight control, an unusually high rate of new ideas. The cause-effect relationships were: (1) Seeing faces in the morning on television decreased mood in the evening (>10 hrs later) and improved mood the next day (>24 hrs later), yet had no detectable effect before that (0â10 hrs later). The effect was strongest if the faces were life-sized and at a conversational distance. Travel across time zones reduced the effect for a few weeks. (2) Standing 8 hours per day reduced early awakening and made sleep more restorative, even though more standing was associated with less sleep. (3) Morning light (1 hr/day) reduced early awakening and made sleep more restorative. (4) Breakfast increased early awakening. (5) Standing and morning light together eliminated colds (upper respiratory tract infections) for more than 5 years. (6) Drinking lots of water, eating low-glycemic-index foods, and eating sushi each caused a modest weight loss. (7) Drinking unflavored fructose water caused a large weight loss that has lasted more than 1 year. While losing weight, hunger was much less than usual. Unflavored sucrose water had a similar effect. The new theory of weight control, which helped discover this effect, assumes that flavors associated with calories raise the body-fat set point: The stronger the association, the greater the increase. Between meals the set point declines. Self-experimentation lasting months or years seems to be a good way to generate plausible new ideas.},

  Abstract                 = {This article provides an introductory summary to the formulation and application of exponential random graph models for social networks. The possible ties among nodes of a network are regarded as random variables, and assumptions about dependencies among these random tie variables determine the general form of the exponential random graph model for the network. Examples of different dependence assumptions and their associated models are given, including Bernoulli, dyad-independent and Markov random graph models. The incorporation of actor attributes in social selection models is also reviewed. Newer, more complex dependence assumptions are briefly outlined. Estimation procedures are discussed, including new methods for Monte Carlo maximum likelihood estimation. We foreshadow the discussion taken up in other papers in this special edition: that the homogeneous Markov random graph models of Frank and Strauss [Frank, O., Strauss, D., 1986. Markov graphs. Journal of the American Statistical Association 81, 832-842] are not appropriate for many observed networks, whereas the new model specifications of Snijders et al.

  Abstract                 = {This paper is concerned with computing graph edit distance. One of the criticisms that can be leveled at existing methods for computing graph edit distance is that they lack some of the formality and rigor of the computation of string edit distance. Hence, our aim is to convert graphs to string sequences so that string matching techniques can be used. To do this, we use a graph spectral seriation method to convert the adjacency matrix into a string or sequence order. We show how the serial ordering can be established using the leading eigenvector of the graph adjacency matrix. We pose the problem of graph-matching as a maximum a posteriori probability (MAP) alignment of the seriation sequences for pairs of graphs. This treatment leads to an expression in which the edit cost is the negative logarithm of the a posteriori sequence alignment probability. We compute the edit distance by finding the sequence of string edit operations which minimizes the cost of the path traversing the edit lattice. The edit costs are determined by the components of the leading eigenvectors of the adjacency matrix and by the edge densities of the graphs being matched. We demonstrate the utility of the edit distance on a number of graph clustering problems.},

Nevertheless, when viewed in the aggregate the degree of mobilization achieved during the short period of active US involvement was remarkable. The United States entered the war in 1917 having made only limited preparations. In 1918 the armed forces were expanded to include 2.9 million sailors, soldiers, and marines; 6 percent of the labor force in the 15 to 44 age bracket. Overall in 1918, one fifth or more of the nation's resources was devoted to the war effort. By the time the Armistice was signed in 1919 a profusion of new weapons was flowing from American factories.

  Abstract                 = {The distribution of votes in presidential elections suggests that Democrats should be at a severe disadvantage in elections to the U.S. House of Representatives because of an inefficient geographic support distribution, yet they have controlled the chamber for 75 percent of the post-war sessions, largely because they are able to win and retain seats in relatively conservative districts. This paper argues that both phenomena are the result of a pronounced left skew in the distribution of district-level preferences owing to the geography of industrialization and urbanization, combined with a presidential system that absolves parties of the need to set binding national platforms. We use the Annenberg National Election Study to estimate the distribution of preferences on economic and social issues within electoral districts, employing a Bayesian hierarchical model that leverages district-level demographic information to obtain improved estimates of median preferences. Our results suggest that the urban districts dominated by Democrats are not only further from the median district than the suburban and rural districts on the right, but they are also more ideologically homogeneous. This explains why inherent bias in the translation of votes to seats favors Republicans, but Democrats are more successful in âRepublicanâ districts than vice-versa.},

While some tout the benefits of "market-preserving" federalism, others point to the fragmentation and incoherence of policy in federal states. This research bridges the divide by analyzing the political and fiscal structures that are likely to account for the highly divergent economic experiences of federal systems around the world. To test these propositions, the authors use an original data set to conduct analyses of budget balance and inflation in fifteen federations around the world from 1978 through 1996. The empirical research suggests that the level of fiscal decentralization, the nature of intergovernmental finance, and vertical partisan relations all influence macroeconomic outcomes. The findings have broad implications for the widespread move toward greater decentralization and for the theoretical literatures on federalism and macroeconomics.},

We argue that methodological problems with the empirical strategies employed in this literature leave the results open to diverse interpretations. In many cases, the indicators of openness used by researchers are poor measures of trade* barriers or are highly correlated with other sources of bad economic performance. In other cases, the methods used to ascertain the link between trade policy and growth have serious shortcomings. Papers that we review include those by Dollar (1992), Ben-David (1993), Sachs and Warner (1995), Edwards (1998), and Frankel and Romer (1999). We find little evidence that open trade policies-in the sense of lower tariff and nontariff barriers to trade-are significantly associated with economic growth.},

The correlation holds for most measures of government spending, in low-as well as high-income samples, and is robust to the inclusion of a wide range of controls. One explanation is that government spending plays a risk-reducing role in economies exposed to a significant amount of external risk. The Paper provides a range of evidence consistent with this hypothesis. In particular, the relationship between openness and government size is strongest when terms-of-trade risk is highest.},

Our results indicate that the quality of institutions "trumps" everything else. Once institutions are controlled for, conventional measures of geography have at best weak direct effects on incomes, although they have a strong indirect effect by influencing the quality of institutions. Similarly, once institutions are controlled for, trade is almost always insignificant, and often enters the income equation with the "wrong"(i.e., negative) sign. We relate our results to recent literature, and where differences exist, trace their origins to choices on samples, specification, and instrumentation.},

Each partyÃ¢â¬â¢s policy makers comprise two factions, one concerned with maximizing the welfare of its constituency, or its core, the other with winning over swing voters. An application to competition over redistribution produces equilibria in which each party proposes a piece-wise linear tax schedule, and these schedules coincide for a possibly large interval of middle-income voters.

  Abstract                 = {In the twenty-first century, globalization poses major challenges to the key players in U.S. domestic politics--challenges similar to many that Americans have faced from abroad since the nation's founding. But it is only in recent decades that links have been drawn between the study of American political development and international relations; even now, emphasis falls primarily on how domestic politics affects the world arena. This book redresses the imbalance. Ten leading scholars explore how, over the past two centuries, the changing positions of the United States in the world economy and in the international political order have shaped U.S. political institutions and domestic politics. Ira Katznelson, Aristide R. Zolberg, and Robert O. Keohane demonstrate the central role that efforts to contend with foreign military and economic competition played in forming the major institutions of U.S. government from the framing of the Constitution through the Civil War. Martin Shefter, Theda Skocpol (writing with Ziad Munson, Andrew Karch, and Bayliss Camp), Ronald Rogowski, and Judith Goldstein show how the nation's political institutions were transformed by problems of war and trade the U.S. subsequently faced. Aaron L. Friedberg, Bartholomew H. Sparrow, and Peter A. Gourevitch conclude the volume by analyzing how international conflicts during and after the Cold War influenced governmental institutions and domestic politics in the United States over the past fifty years. Shaped by War and Trade sets the agenda for further exploration of a topic whose discussion is long overdue.},

A traditional three-factor model then predicts quite specific coalitions and cleavages among owners of land, labor, and capital, depending only on the given country's level of economic development and its land-labor ratio. A preliminary survey of historical periods of expanding and contracting trade, and of such specific cases as the German @'marriage of iron and rye,@' U.S. and Latin American populism, and Asian socialism, suggests the accuracy of this hypothesis. While the importance of such other factors as cultural divisions and political inheritance cannot be denied, the role of exogenous changes in the risks and costs of trade deserves further investigation.},

  Abstract                 = {A straightforward extension of the standard Stigler-Peltzman model of regulation, coupled with a Taagepera-Shugart analysis of electoral-system effects, suggests: (a) that the greater seat-vote elasticities of majoritarian electoral systems will tilt policy in favor of consumers, while proportional systems should strengthen producers; and (b) that the pro-consumer bias of majoritarian systems should be manifested in systematically lower prices. Empirical tests, controlling for the structural determinants of national price levels established in the earlier "law of one price" literature, establish majoritarian electoral systems as a significant and robust predictor, lowering national price levels in the mean OECD country by approximately ten percent.},

  Abstract                 = {The requirements of presidential nomination and Senate confirmation of Supreme Court nominees present two anomalies: under what circumstances can ideologically extreme nominees win confirmation and, given political polarization and the possibility of a filibuster, how are any nominees successful? This paper employs a simple unidimensional spatial model to explore these anomalies. The principal results show that little change in Court policy is possible with a single appointment, and this fact interacts with certain contexts to give the president a relatively free hand in choosing extreme nominees. Less firm conclusions are reached about the second anomaly, but the analysis sets the stage for further work on that aspect.},

  Abstract                 = {In this paper we analyze the asymptotic properties of l1 penalized maximum likelihood estimation of signals with piece-wise constant mean values and/or variances. The focus is on segmentation of a non-stationary time series with respect to changes in these model parameters. This change point detection and estimation problem is also referred to as total variation denoising or l1 -mean filtering and has many important applications in most fields of science and engineering. We establish the (approximate) sparse consistency properties, including rate of convergence, of the so-called fused lasso signal approximator ({FLSA}). We show that this only holds if the sign of the corresponding consecutive changes are all different, and that this estimator is otherwise incapable of correctly detecting the underlying sparsity pattern. The key idea is to notice that the optimality conditions for this problem can be analyzed using techniques related to brownian bridge theory.},

  Abstract                 = {In a randomized experiment, the investigator creates a clear and relatively unambiguous comparison of treatment groups by exerting tight control over the assignment of treatments to experimental subjects, ensuring that comparable subjects receive alternative treatments. In an observational study, the investigator lacks control of treatment assignments and must seek a clear comparison in other ways. Care in the choice of circumstances in which the study is conducted can greatly influence the quality of the evidence about treatment effects. This is illustrated in detail using three observational studies that use choice effectively, one each from economics, clinical psychology and epidemiology. Other studies are discussed more briefly to illustrate specific points. The design choices include (i) the choice of research hypothesis, (ii) the choice of treated and control groups, (iii) the explicit use of competing theories, rather than merely null and alternative hypotheses, (iv) the use of internal replication in the form of multiple manipulations of a single dose of treatment, (v) the use of undelivered doses in control groups, (vi) design choices to minimize the need for stability analyses, (vii) the duration of treatment and (viii) the use of natural blocks.},

Moreover, despite the homogenizing effects of global financial integration, the political dynamics generated by these electoral rules continue to shape the nature and extent of prudential regulations that countries adopt in the place of banking cartels.},

We find that both foreign currency futures and spot order flow contain unique information relevant to exchange rate determination. When we measure contributions to price discovery using the methods of Hasbrouck (1995) and Gonzalo and Granger (1995), we obtain results consistent with our order flow findings. Taken together, our evidence suggests that the amount of information contained in currency futures prices is much greater than one would expect based on relative market size.},

This increased flexibility in the system reduces per-period cooperation among states but also reduces the possibility that the regime may break down entirely. There is shown to be a trade-off between rigidity and stability in international institutional design in the face of unforeseen, but occasionally intense, domestic political pressure. In a model with a WTO that serves both an informational and adjudicatory role, it is established that agreements with DSPs are self-enforcing, are more stable, and are more acceptable to a wider variety of countries than agreements without DSPs. Evidence drawn from data on preferential trading agreements supports the key hypotheses.},

The escape clause is endogenous in a model of repeated trade-barrier setting in the presence of symmetric, two-sided, political uncertainty. They permit, along the equilibrium path, countries to temporarily deviate from their obligations in periods of excessive, unexpected political pressure at some prenegotiated cost. The architects of international agreements optimally choose a cost so that escape clauses are neither too cheap to use (encouraging frequent recourse, effectively reducing the benefits of cooperation) nor too expensive (making their use rare and increasing the chance of systemic breakdown). The international institution's crucial role is to provide information, verifying that the self-enforcing penalty has been paid (voluntarily), rather than to coerce payment. Escape clauses also make agreements easier to reach initially. Their flexibility reassures states that the division of the long-term gains from the agreement is not immutable.},

  Abstract                 = {Does their need for greater tax revenue force governments to democratize? Most research on contemporary democratization says little about the effects of taxation. Yet there are good reasons to believe that taxation led to representation in the past: representative government first came about in early modern Europe when monarchs were compelled to relinquish some of their authority to parliamentary institutions, in exchange for the ability to raise new taxes; similarly, the war for independence in the United States began as a rebellion against British taxes. Some scholars argue that a comparable process is occurring today: the need to raise taxes forces authoritarian governments to democratize. These claims have never been carefully tested. In this article, the &#145;taxation leads to representation&#146; argument is explored and tested using pooled time-series cross-national data from 113 countries between 1971 and 1997. One version of the argument appears to be valid, while another does not. These findings are important both for scholars who wish to understand the causes of democracy, and for policy makers who wish to promote it.},

  Abstract                 = {The threat of terror, which flares in Africa and Indonesia, has given the problem of failed states an unprecedented immediacy and importance. In the past, failure had a primarily humanitarian dimension, with fewer implications for peace and security. Now nation-states that fail, or may do so, pose dangers to themselves, to their neighbors, and to people around the globe: preventing their failure, and reviving those that do fail, has become a strategic as well as a moral imperative. This book develops an innovative theory of state failure that classifies and categorizes states along a continuum from weak to failed to collapsed. By understanding the mechanisms and identifying the tell-tale indicators of state failure, it is possible to develop strategies to arrest the fatal slide from weakness to collapse. This state failure paradigm is illustrated through detailed case studies of states that have failed and collapsed (the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Sierra Leone, the Sudan, Somalia), states that are dangerously weak (Colombia, Indonesia, Sri Lanka, Tajikistan), and states that are weak but safe (Fiji, Haiti, Lebanon).},

  Abstract                 = {Civil wars have several outcomes: government victory, rebel victory, truce, or treaty. This analysis models state capacity as a theoretical starting point to underpin hypotheses on duration and outcome. To test these hypotheses, multinomial logit and competing risk survival analysis are utilized. These methods allow for the examination of each outcome and its respective duration dynamics. Logit tells us what shapes the probability of each outcome, and hazard analysis identifies the factors that determine the time to each outcome. The models examine the years 1944 to 1997 and find that state capacity is involved in outcome and duration in at least two important ways. An effective state bureaucracy undermines the rebels, but a strong government army does not necessarily enhance the government cause. UN intervention decreases the probability of both government and rebel victory, while increasing the likelihood of a treaty or truce. In addition, rebels have a decreased probability of winning ethnic wars. Forest cover hinders rebels and treaties, while mountain cover tends to help rebels. African wars are harder for governments to win. African wars and ethnic wars are longer.},

  Abstract                 = {The paper both describes the method and presents the results of a study into the degradation (or reduction in effective fire) of infantrymen in defensive combat in the presence of live fire. The starting point was the trials performance of men in simulated combat, the degradation with live fire being assessed from aggregated comparisons with historical, or operational, data. Many factors may account for the variations between particular battles; this approach has successively isolated a set of eight important factors. These have allowed the variations between real battles to be reduced to no more than those found between replicated trials in simulated combat. The process has yielded new relationships for combat modelling.},

By developing a new database, the paper reviews the commitments undertaken by 29 WTO Members (counting the EC as one) under mode 1 (cross-border supply) and mode 3 (commercial presence) in 28 PTAs negotiated since 2000. The paper presents a general analysis from both a cross-country and cross-sector perspectives, and also examines in more detail the GATS+ commitments undertaken in a number of key sectors (audiovisual, distribution, education, financial, professional, and telecommunication services). The paper also discusses the potential economic costs arising from these preferential agreements, as well as the potential implications for the multilateral trading system, and for the Doha round of negotiations in particular. The paper concludes by discussing possible approaches to overcome the potential downsides of PTAs, including proposals for a more pro-active role for the WTO in the surveillance of these agreements.},

The dilemma of responding to evidence: Should our models be judged according to experimental results? The dilemma of modelless regularities: Should models provide the hypothesis for testing or are they simply exercises in logic that have no use in identifying regularities?

  Abstract                 = {The paper is a discussion of the interpretation of game theory. Game theory is viewed as an abstract inquiry into the concepts used in social reasoning when dealing with situations of conflict and not as an attempt to predict behavior. The first half of the paper deals with the notion of "strategy." Its principal claim is that the conventional interpretation of a "strategy" is not consistent with the manner in which it is applied, and that this inconsistency frequently results in confusion and misunderstanding. In order to prove this point, the term "strategy" is discussed in three contexts: extensive games in which players have to act more than once in some prespecified order, games normally analyzed using mixed strategies, and games with limited memory. The paper endorses the view that equilibrium strategy describes a player's plan of action, as well as those considerations which support the optimality of his plan rather than being merely a description of a "plan of action." Deviation from the perception of a strategy as a mere "plan of action" fits in well with the interpretation of the notion "game" which is discussed in the second half of this paper. It is argued that a good model in game theory has to be realistic in the sense that it provides a model for the perception of real life social phenomena. It should incorporate a description of the relevant factors involved, as perceived by the decision makers. These need not necessarily represent the physical rules of the world. It is not meant to be isomorphic with respect to "reality" but rather with respect to our perception of regular phenomena in reality.},

  Abstract                 = {Two players have to reach an agreement on the partition of a pie of size 1. Each has to make in turn, a proposal as to how it should be divided. After one player has made an offer, the other must decide either to accept it, or to reject it and continue the bargaining. Several properties which the players' preferences possess are assumed. The Perfect Equilibrium Partitions (P.E.P.) are characterized in all the models satisfying these assumptions. Specially, it is proved that when every player bears a fixed bargaining cost for each period ($c_{1}$ and $c_{2}$), then: (i) if $c_{1}<c_{2}$ the only P.E.P. gives all the pie to 1; (ii) if $c_{1}>c_{2}$ the only P.E.P. gives to 1 only $c_{2}$. In the case where each player has a fixed discounting factor ($\delta _{1}$ and $\delta _{2}$) the only P.E.P. is $(1-\delta _{2})/(1-\delta _{1}\delta _{2})$.},

  Abstract                 = {Scholars and policy makers have long assumed that trade and financial liberalization encourages developing countries to become more democratic; yet no one has developed formal hypotheses about the causal relationship between globalization and democracy. This article shows that these two trends are indeed related, but not necessarily in the direct manner that has commonly been postulated. Combining theories of embedded liberalism and conflict-based theories of democracy, the model presented here depicts the process that affects decisions to strengthen democracy as trade and capital flows increase. I argue that increasing exposure to international export and financial markets leads to improvements in democracy if safety nets are used simultaneously as a strategy for providing stability and building political support. Empirical evidence is provided by econometric analysis covering 59 developing countries for the time period 1972201397.},

  Abstract                 = {Cases of vote buying with payments made before a secret ballot elec- tion are common but not fully understood. The question is how a political machine is able to ensure votersâ compliance when it can not observe their actual votes. Unlike previous answers to this question, this paper shows that vote buying can be sustained without assuming either observability of votersâ individual preferences or the ability of the machine to violate the secrecy of the ballot. In the model, securing compliance of bought voters who oppose the machineâs candidate is achieved by conditioning the continuation of future payments on ag- gregate electoral results. The results show that it is more difficult for the machine to sustain vote buying where partisan affiliation is strong, or where the political machine has no access to disaggregated electoral results. This last finding is conditional on the observability of voters preferences. When preferences are observed, having more aggregate electoral results available to the public does not prevent vote buying.},

  Abstract                 = {The existence of a trade-off between military expenditures and social spending is widely hypothesized but often difficult to establish empirically. This article constructs a model to test the effects of changes in military spending on federal expenditures for health and education from 1941 through 1979. Important economic, demographic, and political changes are controlled. No systematic tradeoff between military spending and federal health and education expenditures is found, nor in this period was there any significant depressing effect on health and education expenditures by Republican presidential administrations. Thus, the current administration, under which there are major increases in military spending and major cuts in health and education spending, emerges as exceptional.},

Every edge in the tree is given a weight, called adoption coefficient, indicating similarity between the two corresponding page versions. The same coefficients are used to build the tree. In the implementation described, adoption coefficients are derived from comparing texts of the versions, similarly to computing edit distance. The tree structure reflects actual evolution of page content, revealing reverts, vandalism, and edit wars, which is demonstrated on Wikipedia examples. The tree representation is useful for both human editors and automated algorithms, including trust and reputation schemes for wiki.},

Both Obama and Clinton are among the least negative. John Edwards is 3.7 times more negative than Barack Obama and Mitt Romney is 4.7 times more negative than Obama. We also compare the speeches of the candidates to speeches delivered by famous political figures and orators such as Martin Luther King, Ronald Reagan, and John F. Kennedy. For example, we can ask whether a candidate's words are more like those of MLK versus Ronald Reagan. Using our metric, John McCain and Mitt Romney are the most like Ronald Reagan whereas (within the set of primary candidates) the words of Mike Huckabee and Barack Obama are the closest to those of Martin Luther King. Hillary Clinton is by far the candidate closest in oratory to Bill Clinton.},

In the model, production costs vary across countries and trade is intraindustry in nature. Coalition proof Nash equilibria of two different games of club formation are analyzed to evaluate the incentives that individual countries have to join an MFN club whose membership requires them to adopt non-discriminatory tariffs towards one another. The analysis hinges on the insight that when production costs across countries are unequal, a non-discrimination requirement does not affect them the same way. In fact, while aggregate world welfare increases with the size of the MFN club, high cost member countries can be worse off relative to tariff discrimination even though such membership is entirely voluntary. Furthermore, non-members lose due to the formation of an MFN club even if club members cannot raise tariffs on them.},

  Abstract                 = {The Lanchester deterministic combat model between two forces is widely used in literature. Many scientists in the area of operations research have introduced stochastic models to characterize the combat system and make combat result predictions for the early stages of the engagement. Most of these stochastic models have treated the time to kill (time to incapacitate) as a random variable with a fixed (constant) attrition rate coefficient. However, it is difficultunder ordinary circumstancesto obtain times at which casualties occur in actual battles; especially for the opposing side. To overcome this problem, the attrition rate coefficient in a given time interval, and consequently the survivor rate, can be considered as random variables. Our approach differs considerably from others in the way the Bayesian stochastic formulation is implemented. The incomplete beta distribution is chosen as a prior probability distribution for survivor proportion (probability), <I>P</I><SUB><I>t</I></SUB>, of the key targets belonging to either specified side in a battle. Based on the conditional binomial distribution of the number of survivors at a given time, the posterior distribution moments of <I>P</I><SUB><I>t</I></SUB> are found. Probability intervals on attrition rates are placed for specified mission times. This formulation is illustrated with a small-scale, hypothesized engagement between Chief Battle Tanks (CBT) that fire missiles and R10 tanks with gun armament. The data are given in Grubbs and Shuford (1973), where a comparison of the results is made.},

  Abstract                 = {In an earlier study Doyle and Sambanis (2000) [Doyle, Michael W., and Nicholas Sambanis. 2000. "International Peacebuilding: A Theoretical and Quantitative Analysis." American Political Science Review 94(4):779-801.] showed that United Nations (UN) peace operations have made positive contributions to peacebuilding in the short term, helping parties implement peace agreements. But are the effects of UN peace operations lasting? Because the UN cannot fight wars, such operations should not be used to enforce a peace. Peacekeeping operations contribute more to the quality of the peace--that is, to securing more than the mere absence of war--than to its duration, because the effects of such operations dissipate over time. For peace to be self-sustaining, countries must develop institutions and policies that generate economic growth. UN peacebuilding lacks a strategy for fostering self-sustaining economic growth that could connect increased participation with sustainable peace. The international community would benefit from an evolution that uses economic reforms to plug the gap between peacekeeping and humanitarian assistance on the one hand and development on the other.},

  Abstract                 = {The empirical literature on civil war has seen tremendous growth because of the compilation of quantitative data sets, but there is no consensus on the measurement of civil war. This increases the risk of making inferences from unstable empirical results. Without ad hoc rules to code its start and end and differentiate it from other violence, it is difficult, if not impossible, to define and measure civil war. A wide range of variation in parameter estimates makes accurate predictions of war onset difficult, and differences in empirical results are greater with respect to war continuation.},

However, there is little understanding of how to apply this method when individuals or locations experience multiple events in close succession. We explore methods of estimating a multiple event study with Monte Carlo simulations. Allowing multiple event-time dummies to be turned on at once generally produces unbiased estimates, while ignoring subsequent events or duplicating observations to have one observation per individual-event-time create trends in the outcome variable before and after an event that can be misleading to the researcher. We present empirical applications which show that the choice of method can make important dierences in practice.},

Both an ability-to-pay and a benefits-received analysis of burden sharing are conducted. During 1990ÃâÃâ99, there is no evidence of disproportionate burden sharing, where the large allies shoulder the burdens of the small. Nevertheless, the theoretical model predicts that this disproportionality will plague NATO in the near future. Thus far, there is still a significant concordance between benefits received and defence burdens carried. When alternative expansion scenarios are studied, the extent of disproportionality of burden sharing increases as NATO grows in size. A broader security burden-sharing measure is devised and tested; based on this broader measure, there is still no disproportionality evident in the recent past.},

  Abstract                 = {Examining child labor through the lenses of weak agency, distributive inequality, and harm suggests that not all work performed by children is equally morally objectionable. Some work, especially work that does not interfere with or undermine their health or education, may allow children to develop skills they need to become well-functioning adults and broaden their future opportunities. Other work, including child prostitution and bonded labor, is unambiguously detrimental to children. Eliminating these forms of child labor should be the highest priority. Blanket bans on all child labor may drive families to choose even worse options for their children, however. Moreover, child labor is often a symptom of other problems-poverty, inadequate education systems, discrimination within families, ethnic conflicts, inadequately protected human rights, weak democratic institutions-that will not be eliminated by banning child labor.},

  Abstract                 = {We investigate conditions under which conditional probability distributions approach each other and approach certainty as available data increase. Our purpose is to enhance Savage's (1954) results, in defense of âpersonalismâ, about the degree to which consensus and certainty follow from shared evidence. For problems of consensus, we apply a theorem of Blackwell and Dubins (1962), regarding pairs of distributions, to compact sets of distributions and to cases of static coherence without dynamic coherence. We indicate how the topology under which the set of distributions is compact plays an important part in determining the extent to which consensus can be achieved. In our discussion of the approach to certainty, we give an elementary proof of the Lebesgue density theorem using a result of Halmos (1950).},

  Abstract                 = {A central question in the international and comparative political economy literatures on globalization is whether economic integration increases worker insecurity in advanced economies. Previous research has focused on the role of international trade and has failed to produce convincing evidence that such a link exists. In this article, we argue that globalization increases worker insecurity, but that foreign direct investment (FDI) by multinational enterprises (MNEs) is the key aspect of integration generating risk. FDI by MNEs increases firms' elasticity of demand for labor. More-elastic labor demands, in turn, raise the volatility of wages and employment, all of which tends to make workers feel less secure. We present new empirical evidence, based on the analysis of panel data from Great Britain collected from 1991 to 1999, that FDI activity in the industries in which individuals work is positively correlated with individual perceptions of economic insecurity. This correlation holds in analyses accounting for individual-specific effects and a wide variety of control variables.},

It states that the income for the majority of U.S. workers has stagnated or fallen in the last few years leading up to 2007. It looks at three common explanations for the rise of protectionism in the U.S. and then rejects them: that a narrow set of industries are lobbying to turn lawmakers against globalization, that there is a lack of education concerning globalization, and that the need to balance economic interests with national security concerns has resulted in a more protectionist stance. It states that the stagnation of income is the prime reason for the rise in protectionism and that the benefits of globalization have been unevenly distributed.},

There are two main empirical results. First, we find that factor type dominates industry of employment in explaining support for trade barriers. Second, we find that home ownership also matters for individualsÃâÃ¢â¬â¢ trade-policy preferences. Independent of factor type, home ownership in counties with a manufacturing mix concentrated in comparative-disadvantage industries is correlated with support for trade barriers. This finding suggests that, in addition to current factor incomes driving preferences as in standard trade models, preferences also depend on asset values.},

  Abstract                 = {This paper analyzes institutionalized bargaining power of weak states in International Or- ganizations (IOs). To explain when and how politically weak member states increase their bargaining leverage in distributional negotiations I develop a theoretical framework in which IO members bargain under changing institutional constraints. During phases of routine bar- gaining, distributional outcomes depend on the formal allocation rules and the statesÃ¢â¬â¢ political and economic bargaining leverage. The dynamics differ in phases of extraordinary bargain- ing, e.g. when applicants seek IO membership. States that expect distributional conflict from enlargement can block accession negotiations to increase their benefits even if they are po- litically weak. The empirical analysis of distributional bargaining in the EU and the WTO supports the theoretical claim. Whereas the allocation of the budget in routine operations is largely determined by the political and economic power of individual actors, enlargement increases the benefits of member states if they face distributional conflicts from enlargement and credibly threaten to delay the enlargement negotiations.},

  Abstract                 = {One of the perennial questions in the scientific study of war is how war affects the economy. The authors examine the influence that the political developments within three war regions had on global financial markets (CAC, Dow Jones, FTSE) from 1990 to 2000. They embed a rational expectation framework within commercial liberalism, a theoretical strand that tries to assess the interrelationship between war and economic exchanges. Time-series analyses account for the effects that the conflict between Israel and the Palestinians, the first confrontation of a U.S.-led alliance against Iraq, and the wars fought in Ex-Yugoslavia exerted. Using daily stock market data, the authors show that the conflicts affected the interactions at the core financial markets in the Western world negatively, if they had any systematic influence at all. They argue that these results lend some support to the rational expectations version of commercial liberalism.},

The political and military events reported in the lead sentences of Reuters news service stories were coded into the World Events Interaction Survey (WEIS) event data scheme. The forecasting scheme involved randomly selecting eight 100-event templates taken at a 1-, 3- or 6-month forecasting lag for highconflict and low-conflict weeks. A separate HMM is developed for the highconflict- week sequences and the low-conflict-week sequences. Forecasting is done by determining whether a sequence of observed events fit the high-conflict or low-conflict model with higher probability.},

Cross-correlation analysis is used to examine the time delay in the effects of mediation on the level of violence over time. Results show that these effects vary somewhat, depending on the conflict, and differ substantially, depending on who is conducting the mediation. Whether conflict reduction is most effectively achieved with sanctions or rewards is tested. Results show that a reduction in violence is generally associated with mediation combined with conflictual action directed toward both of the antagonists and combined with cooperative action directed to the weaker antagonist.},

He argues that open political competition between government and opposition parties influences threats in international crises, how rival states interpret those threats, and whether or not crises can be settled short of war. Compared to their nondemocratic counterparts, democracies make threats more selectively, but those they do make are more likely to be successful--that is, to gain a favorable outcome without war. Schultz uses game-theoretic models and tests the resulting hypothesis using both statistical analyses and historical case studies.},

  Abstract                 = {The methodological issues that arise in testing Fearon's argument about domestic political audience costs and signaling in international crises are examined, in particular the difficulty of finding direct evidence (1) that escalating a crisis and then backing down jeopardizes a leader's tenure in office, and (2) that democratic leaders are more vulnerable to removal in this event than are nondemocratic leaders. Tests that seek to measure the existence and magnitude of audience costs encounter severe problems of partial observability and strategic selection: the effect of audience costs on a leader's political survival can only be detected by looking at cases in which the costs are actually incurred, but strategic choice implies that the probability of incurring audience costs is a function of their value. A formal model, brief case studies, and Monte Carlo simulations are used to show that these problems bias direct tests against supporting either of the audience cost propositions. Tests based on observed audience costs understate both the mean level of audience costs in the full population and the difference in means across regime types.},

We derive a phase diagram that indicates the existence of three regimes, determined by the values of the degree exponents. In the first regime we regain the known directed percolation mean field exponents. In contrast, the second and third regimes are characterized by anomalous exponents, which we calculate analytically. In the third regime the network is resilient to random dilution, i.e., the percolation threshold is p_c->1.},

  Abstract                 = {Digraph panel data, corresponding to a given set of nodes and the directed graphs (digraphs) on the set of nodes which are observed at two or more discrete time points, are collected in the social sciences and other fields. Conventional models of digraph panel data assume that the data are discrete outcomes of a continuous-time Markov process on the set of possible digraphs defined on the set of nodes. Such models make the implicit assumption that all rele- vant knowledge with respect to nodes is observed in the form of covariates and correctly incorporated in the model, which may not be satisfied in applica- tions. The present paper proposes Markov models which allow for unobserved heterogeneity across nodes by introducing random variables with unobserved outcomes, called random effects. To estimate parameters, maximum likelihood and Bayesian methods are proposedâusing Markov chain Monte Carloâand illustrated by an application to longitudinal social network data.},

We need, therefore, an approach that stresses the systemic complexity of economic networks and that can be used to revise and extend established paradigms in economic theory. This will facilitate the design of policies that reduce conflicts between individual interests and global efficiency, as well as reduce the risk of global failure by making economic networks more robust.},

A decision-theoretic approach is also considered. },

  Abstract                 = {Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling strategies can be used to simulate hidden Markov model (HMM) parameters from their posterior distribution given observed data. Some MCMC methods used in practice (for computing likelihood, conditional probabilities of hidden states, and the most likely sequence of states) can be improved by incorporating established recursive algorithms. The most important of these is a set of forward-backward recursions calculating conditional distributions of the hidden states given observed data and model parameters. I show how to use the recursive algorithms in an MCMC context and demonstrate mathematical and empirical results showing a Gibbs sampler using the forward-backward recursions mixes more rapidly than another sampler often used for HMMs. I introduce an augmented variables technique for obtaining unique state labels in HMMs and finite mixture models. I show how recursive computing allows the statistically efficient use of MCMC output when estimating the hidden states. I directly calculate the posterior distribution of the hidden chain's state-space size by MCMC, circumventing asymptotic arguments underlying the Bayesian information criterion, which is shown to be inappropriate for a frequently analyzed dataset in the HMM literature. The use of log-likelihood for assessing MCMC convergence is illustrated, and posterior predictive checks are used to investigate application specific questions of model adequacy.},

  Abstract                 = {The dominant (though contested) wisdom among international relations scholars is that military officers tend to be more cautious than their civilian counterparts about initiating the use of force. Sobered by the experience of combat, the theory holds, soldiers are hesitant to recommend military action except under the most favorable of circumstances. It might be the case, however, that military conservatism is simply a product of strong civilian oversight. Indeed, scholars have suggested that military officers actually have powerful incentives to promote the use of force, but these predilections may be muted when civilian leaders can punish officers for botched military adventures. In this article, the author details a quantitative, competitive test of these propositions, showing that states with strong civilian control are on average less prone to initiate military action than states without it. The results suggest that civilian control should play a central role in future models of conflict initiation.},

Part II of this Note reproduces the relevant WTO provisions that govern the accession process Ã¢â¬â in particular Article XII of the WTO Agreement. Negotiating accession to the WTO under Article XII is much more complex compared to accession to the GATT 1947, largely due to the increased scope and coverage of the WTO Agreement. The WTO process is also more structured and transparent. Part III describes the modalities of the accession process. The Secretariat, in consultation with WTO Members, has drawn up a set of procedures to be followed during the accession process (outlined in documents WT/ACC/1, 4, 5, 8 and 9).1 This Note examines experience with their operation since the WTO Agreement entered into force on 1 January 1995 using, as a reference point, the experience of Working Parties that have concluded their work.2},

  Abstract                 = {The hallmark of the new positive theories of the judiciary is that Supreme Court justices will frequently defer to the preferences of Congress when making decisions, particularly in statutory cases in which it is purportedly easy for Congress to reverse the Court. Alternatively, judicial attitudinalists argue that the institutional structures facing the Court allow the justices to vote their sincere policy preferences. This paper compares these sincere and sophisticated models of voting behavior by Supreme Court justices. Using a variety of tests on the votes of Supreme Court justices in statutory cases decided between 1947 and 1992, I find some evidence of sophisticated behavior, but most tests suggest otherwise. Moreover, direct comparisons between the two models unambiguously favor the attitudinal model. I conclude that the justices overwhelmingly engage in rationally sincere behavior.},

  Abstract                 = {Although elites within countries are the ones who make important foreign policy decisions, most studies of international conflict have treated countries as the primary unit of analysis. We consider a crisis bargaining model that incorporates the decision-making process at the domestic level, and propose a micro-mechanism of rational war. Previous studies have found that war is not possible in equilibrium if players have complete information, war is a one-shot costly lottery, and the distribution of power does not change within the standard bargaining framework. We show that war can occur in equilibrium under the same conditions if we take the decision-making process among elites into account. Political uncertainty induced by decision-making processes at the domestic level creates incentives for elites to take the risk of war when the distribution of power in their country favors such a course. As a result, elites are tempted to take such risks against unstable regimes because of their political uncertainty. Moreover, incentives of elites to initiate war depend on the political institution and the distribution of power within their country. The incentives of elites, the type of institution, and the distribution of power at the domestic level are important elements of rational non-unitary-actor explanations for war.},

  Abstract                 = {Economy, and consequently trade, is a fundamental part of human social organization which, until now, has not been studied within the network modelling framework. Networks are mathematical tools used in the modelling of a wide variety of systems in social and natural science. Examples of these networks range from metabolic and cell networks to technological webs. Here we present the first empirical characterization of the world trade web, that is, the network built upon the trade relationships between different countries in the world. This network displays the typical properties of complex networks, namely, scale-free degree distribution, the {\it small world} property, a high clustering coefficient and, in addition, degree-degree correlation between different vertices. All these properties make the world trade web a complex network, which is far from being well-described through a classical random network description.},

  Abstract                 = {The understanding of the immense and intricate topological structure of the World Wide Web (WWW) is a major scientific and technological challenge. This has been tackled recently by characterizing the properties of its representative graphs in which vertices and directed edges are identified with web-pages and hyperlinks, respectively. Data gathered in large scale crawls have been analyzed by several groups resulting in a general picture of the WWW that encompasses many of the complex properties typical of rapidly evolving networks. In this paper, we report a detailed statistical analysis of the topological properties of four different WWW graphs obtained with different crawlers. We find that, despite the very large size of the samples, the statistical measures characterizing these graphs differ quantitatively, and in some cases qualitatively, depending on the domain analyzed and the crawl used for gathering the data. This spurs the issue of the presence of sampling biases and structural differences of Web domains that might induce properties not representative of the actual global underlying graph. In order to provide a more accurate characterization of the Web graph and identify observables which are clearly discriminating with respect to the sampling process, we study the behavior of degree-degree correlation functions and the statistics of reciprocal connections. The latter appears to enclose the relevant correlations of the WWW graph and carry most of the topological information of theWeb. The analysis of this quantity is also of major interest in relation to the navigability and searchability of the Web.},

  Abstract                 = {Theories of revolution vary in terms of the significance of ideol- ogy. One group deny an independent role for ideology in the making of revolutions, whereas the other consider ideology as an important factor along with structure and process. ln this paper I investigate the role of ideology in the lranian revolution by introducing a new approach, namely the qualitative time series (QTS) method, based on the application of the comparative method over time. Specifically, I focus on two periods of Iranian history which witnessed popular up- rising: the early l960Ã¢â¬â¢s and the late 1970Ã¢â¬â¢s. While the former uprising was aborted, the latter led to the 1979 lranian revolution. Contrasting these periods using the QTS method, l contend that the structural and noneagency process factors underwent the same dynamic in both periods, and are not sufficient to explain the different outcomes. Instead,l contend that the change in the ideology of opposition accounts for the difference. To establish the causality I trace the change in the ideology of the opposition and its role in the decisionÃ¢â¬âmaking processes of the actors.},

  Abstract                 = {Hardly anyone expects public institutions to die. Yet a census reveals that fully one-third of the international governmental organizations (IGOs) in existence in 1981 had in fact become defunct by 1992. Most Eastern bloc and many regional developing country organizations vanished or became inactive. During this period a slightly larger number of new organizations was born. Not governments but other IGOs spawned most of the new offspring. Wealthy democratic countries increased their IGO memberships while poor unstable countries increasingly dropped out. This bifurcation was accompanied by greater reliance by all on a set of core universal-membership institutions dominated by Western values. Functionalism, organizational ecology, and realism each partly help us to understand these trends but leave important dynamics unexplained.},

  Abstract                 = {A distributed lag estimator is developed here from Bayesian priors regarding the"smoothness" of the lag curve. "Smoothness" priors of the dth degree are represented by a normal density function with zero mean of the difference of order d + 1 of the coefficients, where d will usually be one to zero. Such probabilistic priors, which do not imply any parametrization of the lag curve, are, it is contended here, a more accurate representation of the kind of prior knowledge that has led many researchers to use the polynomial distributed lag estimation procedure, and other parametrization procedures, in the past. The estimator developed here is, moreover, very simple in its implementation. All that is needed is any least squares regression program.},

  Abstract                 = {This article updates earlier analyses of peacekeeping burden-sharing for the 1994-2000 period. In particular, we apply a Kendall tau test to determine whether peacekeeping burdens are being shouldered by the large countries for the small countries in recent years. This test indicates the rank correlation between GDP and peacekeeping burdens. Two sets of countries are examined: NATO allies and a broader sample of the primary supporters of peacekeeping missions. The study investigates burden-sharing not only for UN-led peacekeeping missions, but also for UN-led and non-UN-led missions (for example, Implementation Force in Bosnia, the Kosovo Force). Our spending proxy for non-UN-led peacekeeping missions relies on troop expense and is much more systematic than proxies in prior studies. The statistical findings indicate that burden-sharing is disproportionate during recent years when compared with the Cold War era. This result suggests that peacekeeping has a relatively large share of purely public benefits, which is leading to some `exploitation of the large by the small'. It is anticipated that this disproportionality will increase over time and lead to more suboptimal allocation of resources to peacekeeping from a global vantage point. This article also extends the analysis to investigate the rank correlation between GDP per capita and peacekeeping burdens in order to ascertain whether the rich are being exploited by the poor. There is some evidence of disproportionate burdens being carried by the rich for just the NATO sample during two recent years when both UN-led and non-UN-led missions are included.},

  Abstract                 = {While many researches operationalize economic interdependence as trade, we argue that foreign direct investment (FDI) is just as good a proxy for measuring economic interdependence as the level of trade ties. It is so because interstate economic relations are characterized just as much by foreign investments as by trade between countries. Similarly to trade, FDI are understood as a means to promote peace. Yet, although research on the relationship of FDI and conflict has been gradually increasing in recent years, studies have not yet focused on examining the effect of foreign direct investment on conflict across the three industrial sectors. It is the issue that is at the focus of our study. We expect to find not only that higher level interdependence ÃÆÃ¢â¬Å¡ÃâÃ¢â¬â understood as the ratio of inward FDI stock and GDP ÃÆÃ¢â¬Å¡ÃâÃ¢â¬â makes conflict less likely, but also that there are differences across the primary, secondary and tertiary sectors. More specifically, on the bases of the FDI volumes and military strategic considerations, we expect the secondary sector to have the largest negative impact on the likelihood of military interstate disputes. We use the Correlates of War projectÃÆÃ¢â¬Å¡ÃâÃ¢â¬â¢s Militarized Interstate Dispute database and we merge it with our own dataset on inward FDI stock inflow. We also control for several factors: trade, economic growth (GDP per capita), relative capabilities, major power status, alliance structure, dyadic democracy, and contiguity. We use a time-series cross-section logit analysis that covers the period between 1970 and 1992. Contrary to our expectations, only the tertiary sector has a negative impact on conflict initiation, however, a more apt conclusion is that inward FDI stock has no effect on militarized interstate disputes since no significant relationship could be uncovered between FDI and conflict. This result suggests that the analysis should be extended to the more common FDI flow measure.},

  Abstract                 = {Presidents traditionally have had great success when nominating justices to the Supreme Court, with confirmation being the norm and rejection being the rare exception. While the confirmation process usually ends with the nominee taking a seat on the Court, however, there is a great deal of variance in the amount of time it takes the Senate to act. To derive a theoretical explanation of this underlying dynamic in the confirmation process, we draw on a spatial model of presidential nominations to the Court. We then employ a hazard model to test this explanation, using data on all Supreme Court nominations and confirmations since the end of the Civil War. Our primary finding is that the duration of the confirmation process increases as the ideological distance between the president and the Senate increases. We also find evidence that suggests that the duration increases for critical nominees and chief justices and decreases for older nominees, current and previous senators, and nominees with prior experience on state and federal district courts.},

By examining three types of antismoking policy choices by the 675 largest U.S. cities between 1975 and 2000, we uncover robust patterns of policy diffusion, yielding three key findings. First, we distinguish among and find evidence for four mechanisms of policy diffusion: learning from earlier adopters, economic competition among proximate cities, imitation of larger cities, and coercion by state governments. Second, we find a temporal component to these effects, with imitation being a more short-lived diffusion process than the others. Third, we show that these mechanisms are conditional, with larger cities being better able to learn from others, less fearful of economic spillovers, and less likely to rely on imitation.},

  Abstract                 = {What makes some wars longer and more severe than others is an important question in international relations scholarship. One underexplored answer to this question is the role that third party joiners play in lengthening conflicts, especially those states that intervene militarily after a war’s initial stages. This article argues that late joining complicates bargaining by adding new issues to the war and increases uncertainty about the relative balance of forces. Thus, more information will be needed to resolve the bargaining impasse. This means additional fighting and a longer war. This lengthening in turn increases the number of casualties. This is a distinct process from simply having more participants in a war from the outset as those participants would not add uncertainty in the same way that late joiners do since questions about how those participants affect the relative balances of forces would be answered just as quickly as if there were only two participants at the outset. These claims are supported by a non-proportional hazards model regression, a Cox proportional hazards regression, and an ordinary least squares regression using the Correlates of War interstate war dataset.},

  Abstract                 = {Researchers face two major problems when applying ideal point estimation techniques to state legislatures. First, longitudinal roll-call data are scarce. Second, even when such data exist, scaling ideal points within a single state is an inadequate approach. No comparisons can be made between these estimates and those for other state legislatures or for Congress. Our project provides a solution. We exploit a new comparative dataset of state legislative roll calls to generate ideal points for legislators. Taking advantage of the fact that state legislators sometimes go on to serve in Congress, we create a common ideological scale. Using these bridge actors, we estimate state legislative ideal points in congressional common space for 11 states. We present our results and illustrate how these scores can be used to address important topics in state and legislative politics.},

This article introduces a model of interdependent decision making within social networks, in which individuals have heterogeneous motivations to participate, and networks are defined via a qualitative typology mirroring common empirical contexts. The analysis finds that some metrics for networks' influence2014size, the prevalence of weak ties, the presence of elites2014have a more complex interaction with network structure and individual motivations than has been previously acknowledged. For example, in some contexts additional network ties decrease participation. This presents the potential for selection bias in empirical studies. The model offers a fuller characterization of the role of network structure and predicts expected levels of participation across network types and distributions of motivations as a function of network size, weak and strong ties, and elite influence.},

It contributes to this literature by reminding us that comparative statics analysis can be applied to the equilibria of these models. There are a number of claims in CYZ, however, that require clarification. In particular, the article's primary claim is that comparative statics analysis, in combination with one of three proposed statistical estimators, provides a simpler alternative to methods previously advocated. This claim (or combination of claims) is incorrect. When one examines the procedure CYZ recommends, it is no simpler for substantive researchers than anything previously recommended. Moreover, none of the proposed estimators are new: they are exactly the same methods introduced in Signorino (1999, 2003), in Signorino and Yilmaz (2003), in Signorino, Walker, and Bas (2002), and in Bas, Signorino, and Walker (2007).},

  Abstract                 = {Social scientists are often confronted with theories in which one or more actors make choices over a discrete set of options. In this article, I generalize a broad class of statistical discrete choice models, with both well-known and new nonstrategic and strategic special cases. I demonstrate how to derive statistical models from theoretical discrete choice models and, in doing so, I address the statistical implications of three sources of uncertainty: agent error, private information about payoffs, and regressor error. For strategic and some nonstrategic choice models, the three types of uncertainty produce different statistical models. In these cases, misspecifying the type of uncertainty leads to biased and inconsistent estimates, and to incorrect inferences based on estimated probabilities.},

  Abstract                 = {It is widely recognized that many of the samples we use for statistical analysis in international politics are the result of some selection process. Not surprisingly, selection models are becoming increasingly popular. At the same time, the role of strategic interaction has begun to play a more important role in statistical analyses. However, it has not been clear how statistical strategic models and selection models relate to each other, or what the effects are of employing one when the other is the more appropriate model. In this article, I 1) clarify why international relations scholars cannot shield themselves from selection bias simply by assuming their results are limited to a given sample; 2) show how recent statistical strategic models relate to traditional selection models and generalize the two sets of models by deriving a correlated strategic model; and 3) examine the effects of misspecifying either correlated errors or strategic interaction. My results indicate that failure to model the strategic interaction produces worse specification error than failure to account for correlated disturbances, In fact, traditional bivariate probit models appear to be superior only when states are almost completely uncertain about each others' preferences. },

  Abstract                 = {Although strategic interaction is at the heart of most international relations theory, it has largely been missing from much empirical analysis in the field. Typical applications of logit and probit to theories of international conflict generally do not capture the structure of the strategic interdependence implied by those theories. I demonstrate how to derive statistical discrete choice models of international conflict that directly incorporate the theorized strategic interaction. I show this for a simple crisis interaction model and then use Monte Carlo analysis to show that logit provides estimates with incorrect substantive interpretations as well as fitted values that can be far from the true values. Finally, I reanalyze a well-known game-theoretic model of war, Bueno de Mesquita and Lalman's (1992) international interaction game. My results indicate that there is at best modest empirical support for their model.},

This article examines the effects of asymmetric noise on the emergence and maintenance of cooperation under such conditions, The results show that positive and negative asymmetric noise have very different effects on strategy performance. For forgiving strategies, positive noise provides a stimulus out of perpetual defection or unsynchronized retaliations, but also opens them to exploitation. For provocable strategies, negative noise triggers unsynchronized retaliations or perpetual defection, although this may be tempered by generosity and contrition. The effects of neutral noise reflects the signature of each asymmetric noise type. Of the strategies examined, contrite tit-for-tat (CTFT) is generally one of the best performers in both homogeneous and heterogeneous systems. Moreover, one generally sees the evolutionary models moving from heterogeneous bilateral interaction to cooperative norms of behavior, often including or even dominated by CTFT. },

We develop an alternative measure of policy portfolio similarity, S, which avoids many of the problems associated with tau(b), and we use data on alliances among European states to compare S to tau(b). Finally, we identify several problems with inferring state interests from alliances alone, and we provide a method to overcome those problems using S in combination with data on alliances, trade, UN votes, diplomatic missions, and other types of state interaction. We demonstrate this by comparing the calculated similarity of foreign policy positions based solely on alliance data to that based on alliance data supplemented with UN voting data.},

  Abstract                 = { We present a unified theory and test of extended immediate deterrence-unified in the sense that we employ our theoretical deterrence model as our statistical model in the empirical analysis. The theoretical model is a straightforward formalization of the deterrence logic in Huth (1988) and Huth and Russett (1984), coupled with private information concerning utilities. Our statistical analysis suggests that the attacker and defender's decisions are influenced by the balance of forces, nuclear weapons, defender-protege military alliances, arms transfers, and trade, as well as the regime types of those involved. Many of these findings contradict previous research by Huth (1988) and Huth and Russett (1988). We find that many of the variables involved in the deterrence calculus are nonmonotonically linked to the probability of deterrence success or war. We illustrate the results with case studies of the Soviet-Japanese dispute over Manchukuo (1937-1938) and the Berlin Blockade (1948). },

  Abstract                 = {Common regression models are often structurally inconsistent with strategic interaction. We demonstrate that this "strategic misspecification" is really an issue of structural (or functional form) misspecification. The misspecification can be equivalently written as a form of omitted variable bias, where the omitted variables are nonlinear terms arising from the players' expected utility calculations and often from data aggregation. We characterize the extent of the specification error in terms of model parameters and the data and show that typical regressions models can at times give exactly the opposite inferences versus the true strategic data-generating process. Researchers are recommended to pay closer attention to their theoretical models, the implications of those models concerning their statistical models, and vice versa. },

At the same time, the number of individuals achieving a particular level of merit decreases exponentially with the magnitude of the level, leading to a power-law distribution of fame.

  Abstract                 = {For the first time in history, international monetary relations were institutionalized after World War II as a set of legal obligations. The Articles of Agreement that formed the International Monetary Fund contain international legal obligations of the rules of good conduct for IMF members. Members were required to maintain a par value for their currency (until 1977), to use a single unified exchange-rate system, and to keep their current account free from restrictions. In this article I explore why governments committed themselves to these rules and the conditions under which they complied with their commitments. The evidence suggests that governments tended to make and keep commitments if other countries in their region did so as well. Governments also complied with their international legal commitments if the regime placed a high value on the rule of law domestically. One inference is that reputational concerns have a lot to do with international legal commitments and compliance. Countries that have invested in a strong reputation for protecting property rights are more reluctant to see it jeopardized by international law violations. Violation is more likely, however, in the face of widespread noncompliance, suggesting that compliance behavior should be understood in its regional context.},

  Abstract                 = {One of the concerns of international political economy in the past several years has been to theorize about the conditions conducive to the development of international cooperation and institutionalization. This article explores the usefulness of economic theories of dynamic contracting, which are essentially functionalist in nature, to understand international financial innovation in the 1920s. It interprets the founding of the Bank for International Settlements as an important effort to overcome the problems of contract enforcement and information asymmetries in international lending that had contributed to capital market inefficiencies as the 1920s drew to a close. Dynamic contracting theories suggest reasons why borrowers and lenders have a strong interest in developing cooperative international institutions that help establish a borrower's credibility. This approach is supplemented with a multilateral bargaining model between debtor, private lenders, and creditor governments to explain international financial innovation during the interwar years. The evidence suggests that the BIS was created primarily to enhance Germany's incentives to repay its debts and that it was part of a deal between private creditors and creditor governments to reduce and commercialize German reparations. By looking not only at interstate bargaining but also at public/private bargaining, it is possible to understand the paradox of cooperative international institutional development in a period otherwise marked by conflict.},

  Abstract                 = { ABSTRACT One of the most important developments over the past three decades has been the spread of liberal economic ideas and policies throughout the world. These policies have affected the lives of millions of people, yet our most sophisticated political economy models do not adequately capture influences on these policy choices. Evidence suggests that the adoption of liberal economic practices is highly clustered both temporally and spatially. We hypothesize that this clustering might be due to processes of policy diffusion. We think of diffusion as resulting from one of two broad sets of forces: one in which mounting adoptions of a policy alter the benefits of adopting for others and another in which adoptions provide policy relevant information about the benefits of adopting. We develop arguments within these broad classes of mechanisms, construct appropriate measures of the relevant concepts, and test their effects on liberalization and restriction of the current account, the capital account, and the exchange rate regime. Our findings suggest that domestic models of foreign economic policy making are insufficient. The evidence shows that policy transitions are influenced by international economic competition as well as the policies of a country&apos;s sociocultural peers. We interpret the latter influence as a form of channeled learning reflecting governments&apos; search for appropriate models for economic policy. },

We suggest that the factor analysis of word frequencies generated from any political text--for example, open-ended survey responses--provides adequate content analysis categories and can substitute for more commonly practiced techniques. The method proceeds in three steps: data preparation, exploratory factor analyses, and hypothesis testing. This method may produce other benefits by allowing the data to speak more clearly in the development of coding dictionaries while avoiding the problems of inferential circularity common in other data-driven approaches. We demonstrate the method using responses collected in the execution of an experimental design dealing with the topic of partial-birth abortion and assess the demonstration by presenting a human coding of the same material.},

This connection implies that the covariance structure for multiple indicators of distinction is described by a simple single-factor model.

Despite slight method artifacts that sometimes suggested the addition of correlated error terms, a single-factor model provided a precise and parsimonious explanation for all covariance matrices, even when the eminence measures were separated by several decades.

Possible situational determinants included army size, home defense, divided command, and soldier heterogeneity. Military success was gauged according to either a tactical victory or a battle casualty edge (or superior ``kill ratio''). A discriminant analysis of 326 land battles indicated that the victor could be identified 71\% of the time, given the predictors of years of experience, winning streaks, willingness to take the offensive, and divided command. A regression analysis of 205 land battles found that 18\% of the variance in battle casualty edge could be explained if cumulative victory, army size, divided command, and date were known. Individual determinants were more important for predicting victory, whereas situational determinants were more crucial for predicting an edge in battle casualties.

Although the model can be applied to any creative discipline, it was specifically tested on 696 composers in Western classical music. The detection of several significant specification errors in the postulated model necessitated its respecification until a final model emerged. The resulting 7-equation model describes the complex causal network interrelating eminence, creative productivity, creative longevity, life span, creative precociousness, geographic marginality, role-model availability, and birth year. Although the structural model awaits further confirmation on samples of famous creators in other disciplines, the present model is seen as exemplifying a general procedure of causal analysis just recently introduced into personality and social psychology.

  Abstract                 = {Used multiple regression analysis to reexamine C. Cox's (1926) sample of 301 genuises in order to test the hypothesis that ranked eminence of creators and leaders is a function of both substantive (developmental and productive) variables and methodological artifacts. Results indicate that ranked eminence is (a) a curvilinear inverted- U function of education for creators but a negative linear function for leaders, (b) a positive linear functions of versatility for leaders only, and (c) a curvilinear U -shaped function of life span for creators but a ``backwards- J '' function for leaders. Although creators were more intelligent than leaders, the correlation that Cox found between intelligence and ranked eminence was shown to be an artifact of data reliability and especially, a time-wise sampling bias. It was also shown that father's status had no direct impact on ranked eminence.

An archival research design was introduced that simultaneously tests individual and generational factors. The sample consisted of 2,012 thinkers from Occidental civilization spanning 124 generations from 580 BC to 1900 AD. The dependent variable was derived from a factor analysis of 10 distinct measures. A multiple-regression analysis indicated that philosophical eminence is a function of (a) breadth, extremism, and consistency of belief structure; (b) zeitgeist representativeness, precursiveness, and modernity; (c) role model availability (but not ideological diversity); (d) political fragmentation and political instability (but neither imperial instability nor war intensity); and (e) historical proximity to the present. However, despite the significance of the regression equation, an overwhelming percentage (78\%) of the variance in philosophical eminence remains unexplained. Implications of the results and design for further research are briefly discussed.

Moreover, these historical data may be analyzed using either qualitative or quantitative techniques. After giving examples from the subdisciplines of cognitive, developmental, differential, abnormal, and social psychology, the distinctive methodological features of this approach are outlined. These include both data collection (sampling, unit definition, etc.) and data analysis (both qualitative and quantitative). The discussion then turns to the advantages and disadvantages of this research method. The article closes by presenting the reasons why (a) psychologists will probably continue to use historical data and (b) quantitative analyses may eventually replace qualitative analyses in such applications. },

The predictors are years in office, war years, scandal, assassination, heroism in war, and intellectual brilliance. The author again replicated the equation on recent rankings of all presidents from George Washington through William Jefferson Clinton according to a survey of 719 experts (W. R. Ridings, Jr., \&amp; S. B. Mclver, 1997). The original 6-variable equation successfully predicted both the overall rankings as well as the 5 core components of the rankings (leadership qualities, accomplishment, political skill, appointments, character and integrity). The predictive value of the equation was illustrated for the presidencies of Ronald W. Reagan, George H. W. Bush, and Clinton.},

The three most recent measures were then singled out for an analysis aimed at identifying the antecedents of presidential greatness. Hundreds of potential predictors were operationalized, including family background, personality traits, occupational and political experiences, and administration events. Five predictors replicated across the greatness measures and survived tests for transhistorical invariance. In descending order of predictive generality, these are the number of years in office, the number of years as a wartime commander-in-chief, administration scandal, assassination, and having entered office as a national war hero. The theoretical meaning of these predictors is explored in further empirical analysis and discussion.},

  Abstract                 = {Abstract The eponymic theory of leadership maintains that the eminence of rulers depends on their utility as historical labels without regard for their personal attributes. The explanatory scope of this interpretation was tested, for methodological reasons, on a sample of 342 European hereditary monarchs. In support of eponymic theory: (a) About two-thirds of the variance in leader eminence can be ascribed to the number of significant events occurring during the leader's tenure in office; (b) events with positive and negative social valence carry approximately equal and positive weight; (c) events over which the leader exerts considerable control have about the same weight as those over which personal control is virtually nonexistent; and (d) the effects of epochcentric bias and reign span are mediated by the number of significant events. But qualifying eponymic theory: (a) Eminence is not determined solely by the event tabulations (e.g., leader frame is a J-curve function of intelligence and a U-curve function of morality); (b) the number of events is not exclusively accounted for by reign span; and (c) reign span is not solely a function of life span (e.g., reign span is a positive linear function of assessed leadership). The results endorse a form of the theory in which some provision is made for intellectual and personality factors.},

If the network experiences heavy message traffic, congestion occurs due to finite capacity of the nodes. We discuss strategies to manipulate hub capacity and hub connections to relieve hub congestion. We find that the betweenness centrality (BC) criterion is useful for identifying hubs which are most likely to cause congestion, and that the addition of assortative connections to hubs of high BC relieves congestion most efficiently.},

When terrorists and the government act contemporaneously, the equilibrium outcome depends on the effectiveness of the government's countermeasures and the ability of the government to curb popular support of the terrorists through public spending. In two alternative scenarios, the authors establish that leadership may improve both adversaries' well-being while reducing terrorism. The leader changes in the two cases, with the weaker player going first to the advantage of both players. State sponsorship and franchising of terrorists augment violence as both adversaries expend more effort. Sponsors can offset some strategic limits to violence that competition for supporters offers.},

  Abstract                 = {In order to carry out the empirical analysis required of the hypotheses out- lined at the end of Part Two, we must first be more specific and careful about what is meant by ethnic heterogeneity and how to measure it. The first part briefly reviews why ethnicity is important for a number of political outcomes, focusing on a hypothesized curvilinear relationship between ethnic heterogene- ity and civil war. ELF, a widely used measure of ethnic diversity, is examined; then new and old criticisms are enumerated. The second part of the chap- ter introduces a new measure of heterogeneityÃ¢â¬âHETÃ¢â¬âto address many of the most fundamental issues, and discusses the theoretical motivation behind its construction. Inter alia, one significant advantage of HET is that it evaluates the relative proportions of the ethnic groups, consistent with the theoretical lit- erature, whereas ELF devotes the greatest weight to the most dominant group as a result of squaring the proportions. Empirical and hypothetical examples of the differences are discussed. Data are generated for a broad spatial and temporal sample in order to compare the performance of HET with ELF. The new measure and data are then subjected to empirical examination in the context of the debate over how, if at all, ethnic heterogeneity is related to conflict. In the context of secessionist statesÃ¢â¬âi.e., based on an original data set covering all secessionist states from the beginning of the nineteenth century to the presentÃ¢â¬âthe relationship between ethnic heterogeneity and conflict, matching on other covariates, is investigated. The measure is also evaluated using a second data set drawn from a widely cited large-N study. On these samples, and for the dependent variables examined, HET does a considerably better job than ELF of explaining variation in violent conflict. These results cast doubt on some prominent empirical findings and related theoretical claims about the irrelevance of ethnic heterogeneity, while lending support to an alternative line of reasoning that posits a curvilinear relationship between ethnic diversity and intrastate conflict. The results also demonstrate the importance of matching theory and mea- sures more closely. Theoretically, the chapter clarifies the manner in which ethnicity is alleged to matter in theories of conflict and develops a new measure of ethnic heterogeneity to match that theoretical intuition. On an empirical level, the chapter establishes a robust, though non-linear, relationship between ethnic heterogeneity and violent secessionist conflict.},

Two frequently used functional forms are also axiomatized: one in which winning probabilities depend on the ratio of players' efforts and the other in which winning probabilities depend on the difference in efforts.},

  Abstract                 = { ABSTRACT Military expenditures are often funded by debt, and sovereign borrowers are more likely to renege on debt-service obligations if they lose a war than if they win one or if peace prevails. This makes expected debt service costlier in peace, which can affect both crisis bargaining and war termination. I analyze a complete-information model where players negotiate in the shadow of power, whose distribution depends on their mobilization levels, which can be funded partially by borrowing. I show that players can incur debts that are unsustainable in peace because the opponent is unwilling to grant the concessions necessary to service them without fighting. This explanation for war is not driven by commitment problems or informational asymmetries but by the debt-induced inefficiency of peace relative to war. War results from actions that eliminate the bargaining range rather than from inability to locate mutually acceptable deals in that range. },

  Abstract                 = {Domestic audience costs can help leaders establish credible commitments by tying their hands. Most studies assume these costs without explaining how they arise. I link domestic audience costs to the citizens' ability to sanction the leadership for pursuing a policy they would not want if they had the same information about its quality. How can citizens learn about policy quality? I model two information transmission mechanisms: one potentially contaminated by politically motivated strategic behavior (leader and opposition), and another that is noisy and possibly biased (media). In equilibrium, audience costs can arise from strategic sources only in mixed regimes under relatively restrictive conditions, and cannot arise in autocracies or democracies. However, in democratic polities the media can play a mitigating role and does enable leaders to generate audience costs. Still, their ability to do so depends on the institutional protections guaranteeing freedom of the media from political manipulation. Domestic audience costs are not necessarily linear in regime type, as often assumed in applied research.},

  Abstract                 = {Military mobilization simultaneously sinks costs, because it must be paid for regardless of the outcome, and ties hands, because it increases the probability of winning should war occur. Existing studies neglect this dualism and cannot explain signaling behavior and tacit bargaining well. I present a formal model that incorporates both functions and shows that many existing conclusions about crisis escalation have to be qualified. Contrary to models with either pure sunk costs or tying-hands signaling, bluffing is possible in equilibrium. General monotonicity results that relate the probability of war to an informed player\&apos;s expected payoff from fighting do not extend to this environment with its endogenous distribution of power. Peace may involve higher military allocations than war. Rational deterrence models also assume that a commitment either does or does not exist. Extending these, I show how the military instrument can create commitments and investigate the difficulties with communicating them.},

Learning occurs when information is revealed by strategically manipulable negotiation behavior and nonmanipulable battlefield outcomes. I present a model of simultaneous bargaining and fighting where both players can make offers and asymmetric information exists about the distribution of power. In the Markov perfect sequential equilibrium, making and rejecting offers has informational value that outweighs the one provided by the battlefield. However, states use both sources of information to learn and settle before military victory. The Principle of Convergence posits that warfare ceases to be useful when it loses its informational content and that belief in defeat (victory) is not necessary to terminate (initiate) hostilities. Thus, the standard puzzle in international relations that seeks to account for prewar optimism on both sides may not be that relevant.},

  Abstract                 = { ABSTRACT Because war is costly and risky, states have incentives to negotiate and avoid conflict. The common rationalist explanation is that war results from private information and incentives to misrepresent it. By modeling warfare as a costly bargaining process, I show that inefficient fighting can occur in equilibrium under complete information and very general assumptions favoring peace. Specifically, I assume that peace can be supported in equilibrium and that fighting brings no benefits to either state, only costs. Although there exist agreements that Pareto-dominate the final settlement, states may prefer to fight. The result turns on the ability of states to impose costs on their opponents and bear costs in return. The existence of a range of acceptable settlements and the threat to revert to particularly disadvantageous ones make inefficient equilibria possible. A diminished ability to hurt the enemy, not simply military victory, is a major reason to stop fighting.This article is a shorter version of the first chapter of my dissertation.

  Abstract                 = {Recent advances in computational methods for extracting party positions from political texts have provided scholars promising new ways for estimating party positions. However, existing methods face serious challenges when it comes to producing time-series data. This leaves a gap in the literature on estimating party ideology. We fill this gap by proposing a scaling technique to estimate positions over time based on word frequencies in political texts. Using simulations, we first demonstrate that our scaling technique produces accurate ideal point estimates. We then estimate the positions of German political parties from 1990-2005 from word frequencies in party manifestos. The extracted positions reflect changes in the party system more accurately than existing time-series positions. Our method allows us to examine which words are important for placing parties on the left and the right. We find that words with strong political connotations are the best discriminators between parties. Finally, we include a series of robustness checks and demonstrate that our positions seem to be insensitive to distributional assumptions and document selection.},

  Abstract                 = {The author models warfare as a random-walk stochastic process. Rather than model war as a single-shot lottery, as is common in the literature, nations fight a series of battles. Nations do not defeat their foe in a single battle; rather, victory results from aggregate success over a series of interactions. Only by gradually reducing an opponent's capacity to resist can a nation force victory. Yet, under many circumstances, nations preempt defeat by surrendering once the tide of war moves against them. The author characterizes the distribution of resources that results in conflict. Against this background, the author examines how the preferences of leaders affect the conditions under which war occurs. Because the preferences of leaders affect the pattern of conflict, citizens' electoral choices are made contingent on the international environment. Hence, the author provides a link between conflict behavior and domestic electoral processes.},

This perspective is tested using daily data for the entire period, and the effect of news during and after the Civil War is measured. New evidence of a decline in the volatility of gold returns after the Resumption Act of 1875 provides statistical support for the importance of expectations of resumption. },

To those who fight and die on it, it is seldom clear where the journey will endâand those responsible for finding the path are rarely more perceptive. Of the few signposts that exist, perhaps the most visible is the cease-fire. No war ends without one. Stopping Wars is the first attempt to catalog the reasons why some wars are so difficult to stopâeven when both sides want the fighting to end.James Smith examines the problems encountered by protagonists as well as third parties attempting to achieve a cease-fire. Each chapter is devoted to a specific obstacle that Smith analyzes and then illustrates via in-depth case studies, drawing on such conflicts as the Iran/Iraq War, the Gulf War, and the Yugoslav wars. Smith assesses the role of third parties in trying to persuade people to stop fighting and examines what happens when obstacles to a cease-fire cannot be overcome.},

  Abstract                 = { ABSTRACT In recent years two parallel trends have emerged in the organizationof international trade. The first development is the rise ofregionalism, with a host of new integration initiatives drawn alonggeographical lines. More than thirty regional accords were officiallynotified to the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) between1990 and 1994 alone, a total exceeding that of any previous five-yearperiod. The second is a distinct but less widespread move towardlegalism in the enforcement of trade agreements. To an unusual extenttrading states have delegated to impartial third parties the authorityto review and issue binding rulings on alleged treaty violations, attimes based on complaints filed by nonstate or supranational actors.Separately, the two trends have garnered scholarly attention, sparkingcomparative analysis of regional versus multilateral arrangements anddebates regarding the politicaldynamics of judicializationwithinindividualpacts, especiallyin Europe. The intersection of these twotrends, however, remains little examined. },

  Abstract                 = { One of the central tasks facing any discipline is deciding what topics, among a vast range of possibilities, to feature in its research agenda. Once a discipline&apos;s practitioners have settled on the agenda, they must then determine what methods can best illuminate those topics. This essay argues that political science today needs to give higher priority to studies of the processes, especially the political processes, through which conceptions of political membership, allegiance, and identity are formed and transformed. To do this, we need to identify, to a greater extent than most political scientists have, the historical contexts of the conflicts and political institutions that have contributed to political identities and commitments, and our approaches must provide empathetic interpretive understandings of human consciousnesses and values. We cannot rely solely, or even predominantly, on efforts to identify abstract, ahistorical, and enduring regularities in political behavior such as those that prevailed during the behavioralist era of modern American political science. Nor can we depend primarily on approaches, ascendant in our discipline&apos;s more recent &ldquo;rational choice&rdquo; phase, that enhance our formal grasp of instrumental rationality.

  Abstract                 = { The recent renaissance in the theoretical analysis of intergovernmental organizations has focused on formal IGOsâlegalized interstate arrangements coordinated through permanent secretariats with varying degrees of autonomy. But many intergovernmental organizations are informal in natureâthey are not subject to a formal treaty and/or do not have a permanent secretariat. Important examples include the various G-groups that are the locus of much high-level interaction among states. What does the broader set of informal intergovernmental organizations (IIGO) look like? How can they best be conceptualized in relation to the full spectrum of international institutions? Why would states choose to create and work through an IIGO rather than a formal IGO? We build on the analysis of soft law, informal agreements, and informal governance to understand why IIGOs are important in their own right and are not just stepping stones to more formal organizationsâalthough we are also interested in that possibility. IIGOs act as complements for formal IGOs when states face high uncertainty surrounding other statesâ preferences and the state of the world; IIGOs offer a low risk forum for creating focal point solutions that can be implemented through independent state action. IIGOs act as substitutes for formal IGOs when states need increased flexibility, speed, ambiguity or weaker enforcement. We place IIGOs along a spectrum of intergovernmental arrangements with varying degrees of formality and we supplement this theoretical analysis by developing a comprehensive list of informal intergovernmental organizations. },

  Abstract                 = {Stochastic actor-based models are models for network dynamics that can represent a wide variety of influences on network change, and allow to estimate parameters expressing such influences, and test corresponding hypotheses. The nodes in the network represent social actors, and the collection of ties represents a social relation. The assumptions posit that the network evolves as a stochastic process [`]driven by the actors', i.e., the model lends itself especially for representing theories about how actors change their outgoing ties. The probabilities of tie changes are in part endogenously determined, i.e., as a function of the current network structure itself, and in part exogenously, as a function of characteristics of the nodes ([`]actor covariates') and of characteristics of pairs of nodes ([`]dyadic covariates'). In an extended form, stochastic actor-based models can be used to analyze longitudinal data on social networks jointly with changing attributes of the actors: dynamics of networks and behavior. This paper gives an introduction to stochastic actor-based models for dynamics of directed networks, using only a minimum of mathematics. The focus is on understanding the basic principles of the model, understanding the results, and on sensible rules for model selection.},

An algorithm for calculating the Maximum Likelihood estimator is pre- sented, based on data augmentation and stochastic approximation.

  Abstract                 = {A class of statistical models is proposed for longitudinal network data. The dependent variable is the changing (or evolving) relation network, represented by two or more observations of a directed graph with a fixed set of actors. The network evolution is modeled as the consequence of the actors making new choices, or withdrawing existing choices, on the basis of functions, with fixed and random components, that the actors try to maximize. Individual and dyadic exogenous variables can be used as covariates. The change in the network is modeled as the stochastic result of network effects (reciprocity, transitivity, etc.) and these covariates. The existing network structure is a dynamic constraint for the evolution of the structure itself. The models are continuous-time Markov chain models that can be implemented as simulation models. The model parameters are estimated from observed data. For estimating and testing these models, statistical procedures are proposed that are based on the method of moments. The statistical procedures are implemented using a stochastic approximation algorithm based on computer simulations of the network evolution process.},

  Abstract                 = {This review paper articulates the relationship between prediction market data and event studies, with a special focus on applications in political economy. Event studies have been used to address a variety of political economy questions from the economic effects of party control of government to the importance of complex rules in congressional committees. However, the results of event studies are notoriously sensitive to both choices made by researchers and external events. Specifically, event studies will generally produce different results depending on three interrelated things: which event window is chosen, the prior probability assigned to an event at the beginning of the event window, and the presence or absence of other events during the event window. In this paper we show how each of these may bias the results of event studies, and how prediction markets can mitigate these biases.},

We use prediction markets that track election outcomes as a means of precisely timing and calibrating the arrival of news, allowing substantially more precise estimates than a traditional event study methodology. We find that equity values, oil prices, and Treasury yields are slightly higher with Republican majorities in Congress, and that a switch in the majority party in a chamber of Congress has an impact that is only 10\%–30\% of that of the Presidency. We also find evidence inconsistent with the popular view that divided government is better for equities, finding instead that equity valuations increase monotonically, albeit slightly, with the degree of Republican control.},

This is true for at least two reasons: (1) there is significant randomness in voting; as a consequence, on a lopsided vote moderates often vote with the extremists; and (2) our data set includes some roll calls that require a supermajority for passage; for these we define a roll call as lopsided. We also show that the classification-success method of McCarty, Poole, and Rosenthal severely understates the presence of party influence. Furthermore, we show that a proper interpretation of some of their results reveals a significant amount of party influence in Congress.},

  Abstract                 = {This article develops and implements a simple procedure to estimate the extent to which party influences roll-call voting in the U.S. Congress. We find strong evidence of party influence in both the House and the Senate, in virtually all congresses over the period 1871-1998. We do not find any large, systematic differences in influence between the House and Senate. Over the post-war period, party influence in the House occurs especially often on key procedural votes-the rule on a bill, motions to cut off debate, and motions to recommit. In terms of substantive issues, party influence appears most frequently on budget resolutions, tax policy, social security, social welfare policy, and the national debt limit, while it is relatively rare on moral and religious issues and civil rights, and entirely absent on issues such as gun control. On some issues, such as agriculture, public works, and nuclear energy, party influence has varied dramatically over the period we study.},

  Abstract                 = {The study of peacekeeping from an economics perspective is a fairly recent phenomenon. This chapter surveys three research areas pursued by economists in analyzing peacekeeping. The first research strand examines the theory and empirics of peacekeeping financing and burden sharing, while the second strand focuses on the efficacy of third-party intervention in reducing conflict. The last strand utilizes case studies to generalize on the economic consequences of peacekeeping on host nations. In general, the research shows that peacekeeping has a relatively large share of purely public benefits, which leads to a more sub-optimal allocation of resources to peacekeeping from a global perspective. The studies on third party intervention fail to provide definitive answers to the research question. Specifically, theoretical models on interventions showed that intervention may or may not result in the reduction of conflict since the strategic interactions among the warring parties and the intervener bring indirect impacts that are not always clear. The empirical studies were equally ambiguous. On the one hand, multi-dimensional peacekeeping/peace building missions tended to significantly improve the chances for peace, while traditional peacekeeping (such as observer mission) did not. More recent studies showed that intervention by international organizations was not a significant factor in reducing the duration of conflict, while others found early intervention by the UN to significantly reduce conflict. The final research question on the costs and benefits of peacekeeping was addressed through a case study on Haiti, a peacekeeping host nation. The analysis can be generalized to other peacekeeping host nations. For example, host nations may perceive the UN mission much as a military base is perceived in a small economically weak community, as a source of income and employment. This may lead to perverse incentive and increase instability if such an economic source is reduced or removed.},

This typology is then used, along with other factors such as the spatial location of riparians on the river, to explore the question of why some riparians on international rivers have been able to successfully negotiate treaties and others have not. The findings lend support to both economic and political economy explanations of cooperative action on international rivers. International rivers with riparians with countervailing economic and political power are far more likely to have negotiated treaties than other river types. Riparian states on international rivers sharing a "western civilization" were much more likely to have concluded treaties than riparian states on rivers in other civilizations. Somewhat surprisingly, rivers that cross "civilization boundaries" appear no less likely to have treaties than international rivers than run entirely through riparian states that share a single civilization. Adjacent upstream/downstream or "side-by-side" riparians were less likely to have concluded treaties than "country pairs" with other spatial relationships.},

We then examine whether monitoring by the Supreme Court can affect those interactions. We find that the courts of appeals are highly responsive to the changing search and seizure policies of the Supreme Court. Nevertheless, the strong independent effect of the ideologies of the judges gives evidence that judges do find opportunities to "shirk" to satisfy their own policy interests. We also find strong evidence that litigants play an active role in influencing monitoring by the Supreme Court.},

Their analysis poses a major challenge to the battle-death estimating methodology widely used by conflict researchers, engages with the controversy over whether war deaths have been increasing or decreasing in recent decades, and takes the debate over different approaches to battle-death estimation to a new level. In making their assessments, the authors compare war death reports extracted from World Health Organization (WHO) sibling survey data with the battle-death estimates for the same countries from the International Peace Research Institute, Oslo (PRIO). The analysis that leads to these conclusions is not compelling, however. Thus, while the authors argue that the PRIO estimates are too low by a factor of three, their comparison fails to compare like with like. Their assertion that there is "no evidence" to support the PRIO finding that war deaths have recently declined also fails. They ignore war-trend data for the periods after 1994 and before 1955, base their time trends on extrapolations from a biased convenience sample of only thirteen countries, and rely on an estimated constant that is statistically insignificant.},

Current models of pre- ventive war overlook the endogenous choice and the development costs a proliferator incurs. In this article, I construct an endogenous power shift model that incorporates the cost of proliferation. There are three major findings. (1) If the declining state would declare war in response to a power shift, the rising state does not build. (2) The rising state is only willing to proliferate if the additional concessions it will extract are greater than its development costs. (3) In some cases, the rising state ex- tracts concessions without proliferating. Surprisingly, states can use the potential for powerânot just fully realized powerâas a form of bargaining leverage.},

  Abstract                 = {We consider the problem of comparing complex hierarchical models in which the number of parameters is not clearly defined. Using an information theoretic argument we derive a measure pD for the effective number of parameters in a model as the difference between the posterior mean of the deviance and the deviance at the posterior means of the parameters of interest. In general pD approximately corresponds to the trace of the product of Fisher's information and the posterior covariance, which in normal models is the trace of the âhatâ matrix projecting observations onto fitted values. Its properties in exponential families are explored. The posterior mean deviance is suggested as a Bayesian measure of fit or adequacy, and the contributions of individual observations to the fit and complexity can give rise to a diagnostic plot of deviance residuals against leverages. Adding pD to the posterior mean deviance gives a deviance information criterion for comparing models, which is related to other information criteria and has an approximate decision theoretic justification. The procedure is illustrated in some examples, and comparisons are drawn with alternative Bayesian and classical proposals. Throughout it is emphasized that the quantities required are trivial to compute in a Markov chain Monte Carlo analysis.},

  Abstract                 = {The current crisis calls for two main sets of policy measures. First, measures to repair the financial system. Second, measures to increase demand and restore confidence. While some of these measures overlap, the focus of this note is on the second set of policies, and more specifically, given the limited room for monetary policy, on fiscal policy. The optimal fiscal package should be timely, large, lasting, diversified, contingent, collective, and sustainable: timely, because the need for action is immediate; large, because the current and expected decrease in private demand is exceptionally large; lasting because the downturn will last for some time; diversified because of the unusual degree of uncertainty associated with any single measure; contingent, because the need to reduce the perceived probability of another âGreat Depressionâ requires a commitment to do more, if needed; collective, since each country that has fiscal space should contribute; and sustainable, so as not to lead to a debt explosion and adverse reactions of financial markets. Looking at the content of the fiscal package, in the current circumstances, spending increases, and targeted tax cuts and transfers, are likely to have the highest multipliers. General tax cuts or subsidies, either for consumers or for firms, are likely to have lower multipliers.},

  Abstract                 = {Native Americans are unique among domestic actors in that their relations with the United States government involve treaty-making, with almost 600 such documents signed between the Revolutionary War and the turn of the twentieth century. Collec- tively, these texts literally document the creation of the United States as a geographical entity, and represent a series of negotiations and bargaining solutions between actors of widely fluctuating relative power. Their existence, honoring and abrogation have profound consequences for American Indians today. Here we consider the changing nature of treaty negotiations as part of a theoretical, bargaining framework familiar to scholars of international relations. In contrast to previous substantive qualitative approaches, we construct a new data set by digitizing all of the treaties for textual analysis. In so doing, we build on the extant literature by providing a systematic and comprehensive account of the evolution of the documents and their nature. In partic- ular, we employ new âkernel methodsâ to categorize the âharshnessâ of the treaties and show that the time of the Indian Removal Act (1830) represents a systematic shift in language. With a mind to earlier historical and legal literatures, we also show that the âbrokenâ treaties do not form their own cluster in the data, and that the post-1871 âagreementsâ represent a straightforward continuation of earlier treaty policy in both style and substance.},

  Abstract                 = {Climatic and environmental changes and a rising water demand have increased the competition over water resources and have made cooperation between countries that share a transboundary river an important issue in water resources management and hydropolitics. Yet in river basins around the world, international conflict and cooperation are influenced by different factors, and general conclusions about forces driving conflict and cooperation have been difficult to draw. Using global data, this study investigates how combinations of hydroclimatic, socioeconomic and political conditions influence the pattern of water-related international relations (WIR). The data complexity required several steps of statistical analysis. First, patterns of WIR were defined by subjecting the basins' aggregate history of political event data to cluster analysis. Using the classified WIR-patterns as a dependent variable, the study then explores the influence of combinations of explanatory variables on international relations by the means of a multivariate classification tree model. The obtained model, which determines a basin-country-share's most likely WIR-class by its hydroclimatic, socioeconomic, and political characteristics, correctly classifies two-thirds of the basin shares. The tree rules suggest that hydroclimatic variability and population density are most influential in arid to sub-humid basins, while socioeconomic and political factors seem to be more important in determining WIR in humid basins. The application of the model to all international basins worldwide illustrates its potential for the assessment of the global water-related international relations processes.},

  Abstract                 = {While the factors affecting the initiation of war have been extensively studied, the factors that determine the outcome of war have been neglected. Using quantitative data and historical illustrations from the early 1800s to the late 1980s, Allan Stam investigates the relative effect on war outcomes of both the choices leaders must make during war and the resources they have at their disposal. Strategy choices, along with decisions about troop levels and defense spending, are not made in a vacuum, according to Stam, but are made in the crucible of domestic politics. Because of domestic political constraints, states must frequently choose less than optimal strategies in the international arena. Stam shows how we must go beyond simply counting resources and look at the process or strategy by which they are employed as the key factor determining who will win. Challenging the assumptions of many realist and neorealist thinkers on war and interstate conflict, Stam shows how domestic political factors affect the outcome of war. Using a rational choice analysis, Stam looks at the factors that affect the decisionmakers' preferences for different outcomes of military conflict, as well as how the payoffs of those outcomes are affected by both domestic and structural factors. Structural factors, such as the state's population, define a state's power relative to that of other states and will affect the probability of a policy succeeding. Domestic factors, such as the positions taken by domestic political groups, will affect the preferences of the leaders for particular outcomes and their willingness to bear the costs associated with the payoffs and probabilities of the various outcomes. This book will be of interest to political scientists studying war and conflict in the international system as well as to historians and military strategists interested in understanding the factors that predict the outcome of war.},

When controlling for research quality and relevance, the authors generally find that there is no clear relationship between the size of an institution and its productivity. They also find preliminary evidence of positive correlations between the policy relevance and the scientific quality of central bank research.

  Abstract                 = {Previous work has failed to Ã¯Â¬ï¿½nd an empirical relationship between international aid and civil war onset in developing countries. I argue this situation can be redressed when carefully specifying the causal mechanism linking aid and civil war. Governments that receive aid condition domestic extraction policies and the resulting need for deterrence of rebellion on how much aid they expect to receive. Since governments have incomplete information about how much donors value political stability, they sometimes cause more unrest than donors are willing to counteract through aid, resulting in civil war onset. I present a formal model, derive and test hypotheses using data on 28 sub-saharan countries from 1972-1989. Drawing on the structure of the formal model, I use an event history setup with discrete time to produce evidence that higher levels of committed bilateral aid decrease the probability of civil war onset, while aid shortfalls increase the likelihood of conÃ¯Â¬âict.},

I estimate two SAR models with pure respectively impure public good weights and compare their performance in summarizing data on international aid commitments from 1974 to 2006.

  Abstract                 = {If public opinion changes and then public policy responds, this is dynamic representation. Public opinion is the global policy preference of the American electorate. Policy is a diverse set of acts of elected and unelected officials. Two mechanisms of policy responsiveness are (1) elections change the government's political composition, which is then reflected in new policy and (2) policymakers calculate future (mainly electoral) implications of current public views and act accordingly (rational anticipation). We develop multiple indicators of policy activity for the House, Senate, presidency, and Supreme Court, then model policy liberalism as a joint function of the two mechanisms. For each institution separately, and also in a global analysis of "government as a whole," we find that policy responds dynamically to public opinion change. This responsiveness varies by institution, both in level and in mechanism, as would be expected from constitutional design.},

  Abstract                 = {International organizations are equilibrium outcomes that balance the power and interests of the leading state and the member countries. Institutional design is endogenous to this interaction, and includes membership, formal voting rights and informal governance procedures. The model specifies how three particular forms of power interact. Structural power represents the outside options of the leading state and the externalities that its participation generates for other members. Formal voting rights set the policy of the organization and create the parameters within which informal influence is exercised. Informal influence represents an insurance policy for the leading state when its vital interests are affected, and states with substantial structural power may choose to trade formal voting rights for informal influence in order to induce participation by a wider range of states. Hybrid institutional forms involving both formal and informal governance mechanisms are the norm because they make it possible to accommodate the interests of both strong and weak powers. Informal governance can be legitimate because the degree of conflict of interest between the leading state and the membership varies over time, so the member countries tolerate a degree of informal influence in special cases in return for a larger share of decision making authority in ordinary times. This tacit contract depends upon the restraint of the leading state, however, and the legitimacy and credibility of the organization can be eroded if informal influence is used too frequently.},

  Abstract                 = { Why has IMF lending achieved such poor results in Africa? Is it because the Fund imposes the wrong conditions, or because it fails to enforce them? Analysis of monthly data on 53 African countries from 1990 to 2000 shows that the IMF&apos;s loans-for-reform contract lacks credibility because donor countries intervene to prevent rigorous enforcement. Countries that have influence with developed-country patrons&mdash;as measured by U.S. foreign aid, membership in postcolonial international institutions, and voting profiles in the UN&mdash;are subject to less rigorous enforcement (shorter program suspensions). They have more frequent program suspensions, because they violate their conditions more often. The IMF will have to become more independent in order to become an effective champion of reform. },

  Abstract                 = {Why did the Soviet Union squander the political leverage afforded by its trade subsidy to Eastern Europe? Why did Soviet officials fail to bargain with resolve, to link subsidies to salient political issues, to make credible commitments, and to monitor the satellites' policies? Using an unprecedented array of formerly secret documents housed in archives in Moscow, Warsaw, and Prague, as well as interviews with former Communist officials across Eastern Europe, Randall Stone answers these questions and others that have long vexed Western political scientists. Stone argues that trade politics revolved around the incentives created by distorted prices. The East European satellites profited by trading on the margin between prices on the Western market and those in the Soviet bloc. The Soviet Union made numerous attempts to reduce its implicit trade subsidy and increase the efficiency of the bloc, but the satellites managed consistently to outmaneuver Soviet negotiators. Stone demonstrates how the East Europeans artfully resisted Soviet objectives. Stone draws upon recent developments in bargaining and principal-agent theory, arguing that the incentives created by domestic institutions weakened Soviet bargaining strategies. In effect, he suggests, perverse incentive structures in the Soviet economy were exported into Soviet foreign policy. Furthermore, Stone argues, incentives to smother information were so deeply entrenched that they frustrated numerous attempts to reform Soviet institutions.},

  Abstract                 = { With the end of the Cold War, the International Monetary Fund emerged as the most powerful international institution in history. But how much influence can the IMF exert over fiercely contested issues in domestic politics that affect the lives of millions? In Lending Credibility, Randall Stone develops the first systematic approach to answering this question. Deploying an arsenal of methods from a range of social sciences rarely combined, he mounts a forceful challenge to conventional wisdom. Focusing on the former Soviet bloc, Stone finds that the IMF is neither as powerful as some critics fear, nor as weak as others believe, but that the answer hinges on the complex factor of how much credibility it can muster from country to country. Stone begins by building a formal, game-theoretic model of lending credibility, which he then subjects to sophisticated quantitative testing on original data from twenty-six countries over the 1990s. Next come detailed, interview-based case studies on negotiations between the IMF and Russia, Ukraine, Poland, and Bulgaria. Stone asserts that the IMF has exerted startling influence over economic policy in smaller countries, such as Poland and Bulgaria. However, where U.S. foreign policy interests come more heavily into play, as in Russia, the IMF cannot credibly commit to enforcing the loans-for-policy contract. This erodes its ability to facilitate enduring market reforms. Stone's context is the postcommunist transition in Europe and Asia, but his findings carry implications for IMF activities the world over.},

  Abstract                 = {Many biological networks have been labelled scale-free as their degree distribution can be approximately described by a powerlaw distribution. While the degree distribution does not summarize all aspects of a network it has often been suggested that its functional form contains important clues as to underlying evolutionary processes that have shaped the network. Generally determining the appropriate functional form for the degree distribution has been fitted in an ad-hoc fashion. Here we apply formal statistical model selection methods to determine which functional form best describes degree distributions of protein interaction and metabolic networks. We interpret the degree distribution as belonging to a class of probability models and determine which of these models provides the best description for the empirical data using maximum likelihood inference, composite likelihood methods, the Akaike information criterion and goodness-of-fit tests. The whole data is used in order to determine the parameter that best explains the data under a given model (e.g. scale-free or random graph). As we will show, present protein interaction and metabolic network data from different organisms suggests that simple scale-free models do not provide an adequate description of real network data.},

The impact has, however, been uneven. This, in many ways, is consistent with theoretical models of the {GATT}/WTO. The theory suggests that the impact of a country's membership in the {GATT}/WTO depends on what the country does with its membership, with whom it negotiates, and which products the negotiation covers. Using a properly specified gravity model, we find evidence broadly consistent with these predictions. First, industrial countries that participated more actively than developing countries in reciprocal trade negotiations witnessed a large increase in trade. Second, bilateral trade was greater when both partners undertook liberalization than when only one partner did. Third, sectors that did not witness liberalization did not see an increase in trade.},

The developments are partly motivated by computational challenges arising in fitting models of increasing heterogeneity to increasingly large data sets. An example context concerns com- mon biological studies using high-throughput technologies generating many, very large data sets and requiring increasingly high-dimensional mixture models with large numbers of mix- ture components. We outline important strategies and processes for GPU computation in Bayesian simulation and optimization approaches, examples of the benefits of GPU imple- mentations in terms of processing speed and scale-up in ability to analyze large data sets, and provide a detailed, tutorial-style exposition that will benefit readers interested in devel- oping GPU-based approaches in other statistical models. Novel, GPU-oriented approaches to modifying existing algorithms software design can lead to vast speed-up and, critically, enable statistical analyses that presently will not be performed due to compute time limita- tions in traditional computational environments. Supplemental materials are provided with all source code, example data and details that will enable readers to implement and explore the GPU approach in this mixture modelling context.},

When the attributes of a potential armed conflict create uncertainty about the human and material costs of attaining a state's war aims, states are at risk of selecting themselves into long, costly, and ultimately unsuccessful military engagements. The more the actual costs of fighting exceed a state's prewar expectations, the greater the likelihood that it will eventually be pushed beyond its cost-tolerance threshold and forced to unilaterally withdraw from the conflict before it attains its war aims. At the same time, states must fight longer before they arrive at accurate estimates of what it will cost to attain their objectives when the attributes of a conflict contribute to high levels of uncertainty.},

  Abstract                 = {Addressing an Aspect of the Civil War that has long been a source of controversy among historians, David G. Surdam offers an unconventional analysis of the Union's naval blockade. He questions common methods of evaluating the strength of the 3,500-mile siege line, disputes widely held interpretations of its impact, and explores previously unexamined aspects of the blockade as he presents a case for the effectiveness of the Union naval effort.Surdam seeks to explain the failure of the Confederacy to wage war and sustain independence despite an apparently sufficient supply of raw cotton to trade with Europe and Canada for war material and enough beef and corn to feed its troops. To do so he expands the traditional approach to the blockade, finding that a focus on the number of goods that slipped past Union ships overlooks two of the blockade's most important achievements: disrupting intraregional trade and denying the Confederacy badly needed revenue from the export of raw cotton and other staple products.Explicating the blockade's indirect yet devastating results, Surdam examines the degradation of railroad lines, collapse of specific internal markets, and effect on the exportation of cotton. He also explores how the blockade affected the cross-country movement of crops to hungry soldiers and civilians and how costs associated with the blockade consumed most of the higher prices that Europeans paid for Southern cotton.},

While most institutional innovations failed to elicit an immediate market response, the adoption of the gold standard did significantly reduce the perceived risk associated with Japanese bonds. In addition, some geopolitical events, especially the military victory over Russia, improved Japan&apos;s debt capacity. We conclude that well-understood monetary rules and military achievements matter more for foreign investors&apos; perception of a country than do modern state institutions, at least in the short run. },

I argue that the origins of military intervention in politics lie in a fundamental moral hazard problem associated with authoritarian repression. Dictators must deter those who are excluded from power from challenging them. In economically unequal dictatorships, this is best accomplished by employing the military to repress the poor masses. The military exploits this pivotal position by demanding greater institutional autonomy as well as a say in policy, and it threatens to intervene if the civilian leadership departs from a subsequent compromise on these issues. I develop a theoretical model of such contracting on violence and show that the likelihood of military intervention in politics is first increasing and then decreasing in a countryâs level of economic inequality. I find strong support for these claims when I examine original, large-N data on military intervention.},

I develop a new, change-point model of democratic consolidation that avoids some of the pitfalls of many existing empirical studies of consolidation. Specifically, rather than assuming that con- solidation occurs, the present model estimates whether and when consolidation occurs as a function of covariates. I apply this approach to new data on democratic survival that distinguish between two processes by which an overwhelming majority of author- itarian reversals occurs: coups d'etat and incumbent takeovers. I find that the risk of e authoritarian reversals by each of the two processes differs in its dynamic as well as determinants: democracies consolidate against the risk of coups but do not consolidate against the risk of incumb },

We argue that internationalization, domestic economic change, and budgetary pressures each prompt significant changes in tax policy; yet, together, they create a system of constraints on altering the level and distribution of tax burdens. We utilize 1981 to 1995 data from fourteen developed democracies to analyze the determinants of taxation. We find that capital mobility and trade are associated with cuts in statutory corporate tax rates but not with reductions in effective average tax rates on capital income. Moreover, we find that capital mobility is negatively associated with the tax components of labor costs. Domestically, structural unemployment leads to reductions in labor and capital taxes while public sector debt and societal needs raise taxes. We conclude with a summary of the new political economy of taxation in capitalist democracies.},

  Abstract                 = {As suggested by the authors, the Horne and Ostberg morning/evening questionnaire (MEQ) has never been adapted to evaluate a nonstudent population. The purpose of this study was to validate this MEQ in a sample of middle-aged workers by modifying only the cutoffs. It was administered in 566 non-shift-workers aged 51.2 to 3.2 years who presented no sleep disorders. According to the Home and Ostberg classification, the sample consisted of 62.1\% morning type, 36.6\% neither type, and 2.2\% evening type. Multiple correspondence analysis, which determines the principal components, was performed on all MEQ items. Then an ascending hierarchical classification was applied to determine 3 clusters from these principal components. On the basis of these 3 clusters, new cutoffs were determined: evening types were considered as scoring under 53 and morning types above 64, thus giving 28.1\% morning type, 51.7\% neither type, and 20.2\% evening type. As an external validation, eveningness was associated with later bedtime and waking-up time (more pronounced at the weekend), greater need for sleep, larger daily sleep debt, greater morning sleepiness, and ease of returning to sleep in the early morning. A positive correlation between age and morningness was again found. This study confirms that "owls" are not rare in a middle-aged sample. We conclude that this adapted MEQ could be useful when investigating age-related changes in sleep.},

  Abstract                 = { ABSTRACT The shape of the legislative agenda varies through the legislative process. At the policy debate stage, where legislative proposals are introduced, packaged, and debated, members' bill cosponsoring patterns reveal a multidimensional agenda. At the decision stage on the legislative floor, members' voting patterns reveal a low-dimensional agenda. This article compares the dimensional structures of legislators' bill cosponsoring and floor voting activities during the 103rd and 104th Congresses. The analyses show that bill cosponsoring contains at least three and as many as five distinct dimensions, suggesting that pre-floor legislative activities play an important role in structuring the lines of conflict for floor decisions. },

  Abstract                 = {A bivariate simultaneous discrete response model which is a stochastic representation of equilibria in a two-person discrete game is studied. The presence of multiple equilibria in the underlying discrete game maps into a region for the exogenous variables where the model predicts a nonunique outcome. This is an example of an incomplete econometric structure. Economists using this model have made simplifying assumptions to avoid multiplicity. I make a distinction between incoherent models and incomplete models, and then analyse the model in the presence of multiple equilibria, showing that the model contains enough information to identify the parameters of interest and to obtain a well defined semiparametric estimator. I also show that the latter is consistent and Ã¢ÂÂn normal. Moreover, by exploiting the presence of multiplicity, one is able to obtain a more efficient estimator than the existing methods.},

Robust network performance involves a complex trade-off involving cost, transport efficiency, and fault tolerance. Biological networks have been honed by many cycles of evolutionary selection pressure and are likely to yield reasonable solutions to such combinatorial optimization problems. Furthermore, they develop without centralized control and may represent a readily scalable solution for growing networks in general. We show that the slime mold Physarum polycephalum forms networks with comparable efficiency, fault tolerance, and cost to those of real-world infrastructure networks--in this case, the Tokyo rail system. The core mechanisms needed for adaptive network formation can be captured in a biologically inspired mathematical model that may be useful to guide network construction in other domains.},

Data from three disciplines (economics, mathe- matics, and comparative literature) is used to measure the properties of these networks. Departmental in??uence is measured by a method similar to that used by Google to rank web pages. All disciplines ex- hibit a distribution of in??uence that is signi??cantly more skewed than the number of placements. This is due to a strong hierarchy of de- partments, in which movements are seldom upwards. It is also found that, in economics, there are clusters of departments that are signi??- cantly more connected within than with each other. These clusters are consistent with anecdotal evidence about "freshwater" and "saltwater" schools of thought, although this division is on the wane. There is a similar although weaker division within comparative literature, but not within mathematics},

  Abstract                 = {An examination of civil wars throughout the 20th century shows that there is a change in the pattern of civil war durations coinciding with World War II. The literature on civil wars, however, is predominantly limited to the post-World War II era. This paper replicates and extends Fearonâs (2004) post-WW II duration analysis to include conflicts from 1899-1999, then challenges his conclusions about significant types of civil wars believed to be related to civil war duration. I show a substantive and statistically significant break in duration data at World War II. Anti-colonial wars prior to WW II are on average longer than other wars, but are not statistically significant in their correlation to duration after WW II. Sons of the soil conflicts are shorter before WW II, but tend to be longer than other wars after WW II. Coups and revolutions, wars in Eastern Europe, and wars where rebels are funded by contraband sources are not significant in their effect on pre-WW II civil war durations. Fearonâs theory of credible commitments in a bargaining game are sufficient to explain these patterns, but the methodology of his empirical analysis is insufficient to account for the break in civil war duration data.},

  Abstract                 = {Analysts have long suspected that politics affects the lending patterns of the International Monetary Fund (IMF), but none have adequately specified or systematically tested competing explanations. This paper develops a political explanation of IMF lending and tests it statistically on the developing countries between 1985 and 1994. It finds that political realignment toward the United States, the largest power in the IMF, increases a country's probability of receiving an IMF loan. A country's static political alignment position has no significant impact during this period, suggesting that these processes are best modeled dynamically. An analysis of two subsamples rejects the hypothesis that the IMF has become less politicized since the end of the cold war and suggests that the influence of politics has actually increased since 1990. The behavior of multilateral organizations is still driven by the political interests of their more powerful member states.},

The article compares public and academic opinion and rankings of prime ministers and their performance, noting significant discrepancies in contemporary and retrospective evaluations.

The proposed method does particularly well in instances of the Colonel Blotto game in which the battlefieeld weights satisfy some clearly defined regularity conditions. Though these conditions constrain the set of games in which this method reliably generates equilibrium strategies, they are less restrictive than the condition of symmetry across all battlefields, hitherto common in the literature. The paper also explores the parallel between these conditions and the integer partitioning problem in combinatorial optimisation.},

Examining a variety of different institutions including the World Trade Organization, the United Nations and the European Commission, this book explores the different methods that states employ to ensure their interests are being served, and identifies the problems involved with monitoring and managing IOs. The contributors suggest that it is not inherently more difficult to design effective delegation mechanisms at international level than at domestic level and, drawing on principal-agent theory, help explain the variations that exist in the extent to which states are willing to delegate to IOs. They argue that IOs are neither all evil nor all virtuous, but are better understood as bureaucracies that can be controlled to varying degrees by their political masters.},

The stronger and more compact a cluster is, the earlier the eigenvalue representing the corresponding business sector occurs in the spectrum. On the other hand, if groups of stocks belonging to a given business sector are considered as a fully connected subgraph of the final network, their intensity and coherence can be monitored as a function of time. This approach indicates to what extent the business sector classifications are visible in market prices, which in turn enables us to gauge the extent of group-behaviour exhibited by stocks belonging to a given business sector.},

The `lasso' minimizes the residual sum of squares subject to the sum of the absolute value of the coefficients being less than a constant. Because of the nature of this constraint it tends to produce some coefficients that are exactly 0 and hence gives interpretable models. Our simulation studies suggest that the lasso enjoys some of the favourable properties of both subset selection and ridge regression. It produces interpretable models like subset selection and exhibits the stability of ridge regression. There is also an interesting relationship with recent work in adaptive function estimation by Donoho and Johnstone. The lasso idea is quite general and can be applied in a variety of statistical models: extensions to generalized regression models and tree-based models are briefly described.},

We propose the 'fused lasso', a generalization that is designed for problems with features that can be ordered in some meaningful way. The fused lasso penalizes the <tex-math>$L_1-norm$</tex-math> of both the coefficients and their successive differences. Thus it encourages sparsity of the coefficients and also sparsity of their differences-i.e. local constancy of the coefficient profile. The fused lasso is especially useful when the number of features p is much greater than N, the sample size. The technique is also extended to the 'hinge' loss function that underlies the support vector classifier. We illustrate the methods on examples from protein mass spectroscopy and gene expression data.},

  Abstract                 = {We study trend filtering, a recently proposed tool of Kim et al. [{SIAM} Rev. 51 (2009) 339-360] for nonparametric regression. The trend filtering estimate is defined as the minimizer of a penalized least squares criterion, in which the penalty term sums the absolute \$k\$th order discrete derivatives over the input points. Perhaps not surprisingly, trend filtering estimates appear to have the structure of \$k\$th degree spline functions, with adaptively chosen knot points (we say ``appear'' here as trend filtering estimates are not really functions over continuous domains, and are only defined over the discrete set of inputs). This brings to mind comparisons to other nonparametric regression tools that also produce adaptive splines; in particular, we compare trend filtering to smoothing splines, which penalize the sum of squared derivatives across input points, and to locally adaptive regression splines [Ann. Statist. 25 (1997) 387-413], which penalize the total variation of the \$k\$th derivative. Empirically, we discover that trend filtering estimates adapt to the local level of smoothness much better than smoothing splines, and further, they exhibit a remarkable similarity to locally adaptive regression splines. We also provide theoretical support for these empirical findings; most notably, we prove that (with the right choice of tuning parameter) the trend filtering estimate converges to the true underlying function at the minimax rate for functions whose \$k\$th derivative is of bounded variation. This is done via an asymptotic pairing of trend filtering and locally adaptive regression splines, which have already been shown to converge at the minimax rate [Ann. Statist. 25 (1997) 387-413]. At the core of this argument is a new result tying together the fitted values of two lasso problems that share the same outcome vector, but have different predictor matrices.},

However, the usual reasons given for the unquantifiability of reasonable doubt are unsatisfactory; and a recent case, United States v.

While there exists a rich literature on the effects of institutions such as presidents, electoral systems, and bicameralism on government spending, the role of professional bureaucrats has yet to receive formal scrutiny. In the model, legislators bargain over the allocation of distributive benefits across districts. The legislature may either âpoliticizeâ a program by bypassing bureaucratic scrutiny and bargaining directly over pork, or âprofessionalizeâ it by letting a bureaucrat ap- prove or reject project funding in each district according to an underlying quality standard. The model predicts that the legislature will professionalize when the expected program quality is high. However, politicization becomes more likely as the number of high quality projects increases, and under divided government. Further, more competent bureaucrats can encourage politicization if the expected program quality is low. Finally, politicized programs are larger than professionalized programs.},

  Abstract                 = {Do redundant bureaucratic arrangements represent wasteful duplication or a hedge against political uncertainty? Previous attempts at addressing this question have treated agency actions as exogenous, thus avoiding strategic issues such as collective action problems or competition. I develop a game-theoretic model of bureaucratic policy making in which a political principal chooses the number of agents to handle a given task. Importantly, agents have policy preferences that may be opposed to the principal's, and furthermore may choose their policy or effort levels. Among the results are that redundancy can help a principal achieve her policy goals when her preferences are not aligned with the agents'. But redundancy is less helpful if even a single agent has preferences relatively close to the principal's. In this environment collective action problems may cause multiple agents to be less effective than a single agent. Redundancy can also be unnecessary to the principal if the agent's jurisdiction can be terminated.},

  Abstract                 = {This paper introduces a general Bayesian framework for obtaining sparse solutions to regression and classification tasks utilising models linear in the parameters. Although this framework is fully general, we illustrate our approach with a particular specialisation that we denote the 'relevance vector machine' (RVM), a model of identical functional form to the popular and state-of-the-art 'support vector machine' (SVM). We demonstrate that by exploiting a probabilistic Bayesian learning framework, we can derive accurate prediction models which typically utilise dramatically fewer basis functions than a comparable SVM while offering a number of additional advantages. These include the benefits of probabilistic predictions, automatic estimation of 'nuisance' parameters, and the facility to utilise arbitrary basis functions (e.g. non-'Mercer' kernels). We detail the Bayesian framework and associated learning algorithm for the RVM, and give some illustrative examples of its application along with some comparative benchmarks. We offer some explanation for the exceptional degree of sparsity obtained, and discuss and demonstrate some of the advantageous features, and potential extensions, of Bayesian relevance learning.},

  Abstract                 = {How does international law affect preferences and beliefs about foreign policy? I investigate this question by offering the first-ever experimental analysis of treaty commitments. The experiments, embedded in interviews with U.S. voters and British policymakers, reveal three patterns. First, international law transforms preferences and expectations. Individuals are far more likely to oppose policies that would violate international legal agreements than to oppose otherwise identical policies that would not trammel upon existing pacts. Moreover many observers, including expert policymakers, anticipate that signatories to international treaties will behave differently from non-signatories. Second, treaties exert their effects by publicizing international commitments and embedding them in a legal framework. Publicity raises the reputational costs of reneging; legalization further puts reputation on the line and, in some countries, enables domestic courts to enforce international commitments. Finally, the effect of international law is additive, not absolute. If the material or moral case for violating international law is sufficiently strong, large proportions of voters and policymakers will advocate breaking the law and will expect foreign leaders to do the same. Thus, the experiments reported here reveal both the power and the limits of international law.},

Recent theories point to domestic audience costs: the domestic price a leader would pay for making foreign threats and then backing down. This article provides the first direct evidence of audience costs. The analysis, based on experiments embedded in public opinion surveys, shows that audience costs exist across a wide range of conditions and increase with the level of escalation. The costs are evident throughout the population, and especially among politically active citizens who have the greatest potential to shape government policy. Finally, preliminary evidence suggests that audience costs arise because citizens care about the international reputation of the country or leader. These findings help identify how, and under what conditions, domestic audiences make commitments credible. At the same time, they demonstrate the promise of using experiments to answer previously intractable questions in the field of international relations.},

  Abstract                 = {"The previous war in the Middle East was about oil, the next war will be about water." Such predictions have been made regularly, and particularly with reference to the possibility of upstream-downstream conflicts in major rivers which cross interstate boundaries. A good case can be made that competition over water resources may exacerbate conflict and contribute to interstate violence. More than 200 river systems are shared by two or more countries. Many rivers run between countries with a history of conflict, where water plays an important part in the economic life of the country. The dramatic statements about 'water wars', however, have a weaker foundation. As resource optimists have pointed out, there is an abundance of water where it is not subject to wasteful uses, human ingenuity can overcome water shortages, and nations can cooperate rather than fight to resolve international water issues. This study is built on newly generated data on boundary-crossing rivers, which have been added to the Correlates of War contiguity dataset. Our results indicate that a joint river does indeed increase the probability of militarized disputes and armed conflict over and above mere contiguity. This risk factor is comparable in size to standard control variables, but much smaller than the effect of contiguity itself. Water scarcity is also associated with conflict, and the upstream/ downstream relationship appears to be the form of shared river most frequently associated with conflict. But these results are not very strong and we do not have any systematic data on the issues involved in the shared-river conflicts. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.},

  Abstract                 = {Many theories in the study of Congress make very specific claims about the distribution of preferences of legislators. Consequently, many analyses require the estimates of legislatorsÃâ ideological positions. Naturally, the most interesting hypotheses involve cross-time comparisons, and take into consid- eration both the House and the Senate, thus require estimates of ideal points which are comparable across chamber and time. Comparability across cham- bers can be handled by the identification of a set of ÃâbridgeÃâ votes. This pa- per will concentrate on the comparisons across time, with a particular view toward the Senate.},

  Abstract                 = {We apply formal, statistical measurement models to the Polity indicators, used widely in studies of international relations to measure democracy. In so doing, we make explicit the hitherto implicit assumptions underlying scales built using the Polity indicators. Modeling democracy as a latent variable allows us to assess the "noise" (measurement error) in the resulting measure. We show that this measurement error is considerable and has substantive consequences when using a measure of democracy as an independent variable in cross-national statistical analyses. Our analysis suggests that skepticism as to the precision of the Polity democracy scale is well founded and that many researchers have been overly sanguine about the properties of the Polity democracy scale in applied statistical work.},

  Abstract                 = {Do political and fiscal decentralization make it easier or harder to control inflation? Statistical analysis of average annual inflation rates in a panel of 87 countries in the 1970s and 1980s found no clear relationship between decentralization and the level of inflation. Political decentralization, however, does appear to reduce change in countries' relative inflation rates over time. By creating additional veto players, federal structure may "lock in" existing patterns of monetary policy-whether inflationary or strict. Among the (mostly developed) countries that started with low inflation, inflation tended to increase more slowly in federations than in unitary states. Among the (mostly developing) countries that started with high inflation, inflation tended to increase faster in the federations. There is evidence that political decentralization locks in a country's degree of practical central bank independence-whether high or low-and the relative hardness or softness of budget constraints on subnational governments.},

  Abstract                 = {We present a unified model of the politics of the European Union (EU). We focus on the effects of the EU's changing treaty base (from the Rome to Amsterdam Treaties) on the relations among its three supranational institutions-the Commission of the European Communities, the European Court of Justice, and the European Parliament-and between these actors and the intergovernmental Council of Ministers. We analyze these institutional interactions in terms of the interrelationships among the three core functions of the modern state: to legislate and formulate policy (legislative branch), to administer and implement policy (executive branch), and to interpret policy and adjudicate disputes (judicial branch). Our analysis demonstrates that the evolution of the EU' s political system has not always been linear. For example, we explain why the Court's influence was greatest before the passage of the Single European Act and declined in the following decade, and why we expect it to increase again in the aftermath of the Amsterdam Treaty. We also explain why the Commission became a powerful legislative agenda setter after the Single European Act and why its power today stems more from administrative discretion than from influence over legislation.},

The proposed estimation method is easier to use than methods so far developed and it allows a direct comparison with the maximum likelihood estimator. A Bayesian highest posterior density interval inference is made to examine the validity of the Cobb-Douglas representation. The method is applied to Japanese macro data and to micro data on two Japanese manufacturing plants. The results indicate that the current practice of employing the Cobb-Douglas form a priori ought to be corrected. In addition, the micro data present results paradoxical to the commonly held view of capital intensity.},

  Abstract                 = {Firms introducing technologies that exhibit network effects need to understand which adopter characteristics have the greatest impact on the adoption decisions of others. To examine which adopter characteristics matter, I use micro-data on the introduction of a new video-messaging technology in an investment bank for the 2118 employees, their adoption decisions and their 2.4 million subsequent calls. The video-messaging technology can also be used to watch TV. Exogenous shocks to the benefits of watching TV are used to identify the causal (network) effect of one user???s adoption on others??? adoption decisions. I find that network effects vary with both formal and informal influence: Adoption by both managers and workers in ???boundary spanner??? positions has a large impact on the adoption decisions of employees who wish to communicate with them. Adoption by ordinary workers has a far smaller impact. This suggests that firms should target those who derive informal influence from key bridging positions in communication networks, in addition to those with obvious sources of formal influence, when launching a new network technology.},

  Abstract                 = {Ever since the introduction of hidden Markov models by Baum and his co-workers, the method of choice for fitting such models has been maximum likelihood via the \{EM\} algorithm. In recent years it has been noticed that the gradient and Hessian of the log likelihood of hidden Markov and related models may be calculated in parallel with a filtering process by which the likelihood may be calculated. Various authors have used, or suggested the use of, this idea in order to maximize the likelihood directly, without using the \{EM\} algorithm. In this paper we discuss an implementation of such an approach. We have found that a straightforward implementation of Newtonâs method sometimes works but is unreliable. A form of the LevenbergâMarquardt algorithm appears to provide excellent reliability. Two rather complex examples are given for applying this algorithm to the fitting of hidden Markov models. In the first a better than 6-fold increase in speed over the \{EM\} algorithm was achieved. The second example turned out to be problematic (somewhat interestingly) in that the maximum likelihood estimator appears to be inconsistent. Whatever its merit, this estimator is calculated much faster by LevenbergâMarquardt than by EM. We also compared the LevenbergâMarquardt algorithm, applied to the first example, with a generic numerical maximization procedure. The LevenbergâMarquardt algorithm appeared to perform almost three times better than the generic procedure, even when analytic derivatives were provided, and 19 times better when they were not provided. },

  Abstract                 = { The conventional wisdom emphasizes agency slack or bias as the central problem of in- ternational delegation. I show that the possibility of a unilateral influence contest is equally problematic. States can exert unilateral influence on autonomous international bureaucrats, either through rewards or punishments, to pursue their particular interests. A costly contest results, so some states could refuse to delegate because they expect others to be too influential. The analysis has four counterintuitive empirical implications. First, international agreements often favor institutionally weak states that are disadvantaged in the unilateral influence contest. Second, states could limit the autonomy of an international organization even if this prompts bad policies. Third, a state can sometimes profitably exchange distributional concessions for autonomy. Finally, constraints on unilateral influence are possible only if a disadvantaged state can credibly commit to compensating an advantaged state for it. A central broader contribu- tion of the analysis is to show how power politics influences the rational design of international institutions. },

  Abstract                 = {The Partially Collapsed Gibbs (PCG) sampler offers a new strategy for improving the convergence of a Gibbs sampler. PCG achieves faster convergence by reducing the conditioning in some of the draws of its parent Gibbs sampler. Although this can significantly improve convergence, care must be taken to ensure that the stationary distribution is preserved. The conditional distributions sampled in a PCG sampler may be incompatible and permuting their order may upset the stationary distribution of the chain. Extra care must be taken when Metropolis-Hastings (MH) updates are used in some or all of the updates. Reducing the conditioning in an MH within Gibbs sampler can change the stationary distribution, even when the PCG sampler would work perfectly if MH were not used. In fact, a number of samplers of this sort that have been advocated in the literature do not actually have the target stationary distributions. In this article, we illustrate the challenges that may arise when using MH within a PCG sampler and develop a general strategy for using such updates while maintaining the desired stationary distribution. Theoretical arguments provide guidance when choosing between different MH within PCG sampling schemes. Finally we illustrate the MH within PCG sampler and its computational advantage using several examples from our applied work.},

  Abstract                 = { Ever-increasing computational power, along with everâmore sophisticated statistical computing techniques, is making it possible to fit everâmore complex statistical models. Among the more computationally intensive methods, the Gibbs sampler is popular because of its simplicity and power to effectively generate samples from a high-dimensional probability distribution. Despite its simple implementation and description, however, the Gibbs sampler is criticized for its sometimes slow convergence, especially when it is used to fit highly structured complex models. Here we present partially collapsed Gibbs sampling strategies that improve the convergence by capitalizing on a set of functionally incompatible conditional distributions. Such incompatibility generally is avoided in the construction of a Gibbs sampler, because the resulting convergence properties are not well understood. We introduce three basic tools (marginalization, permutation, and trimming) that allow us to transform a Gibbs sampler into a partially collapsed Gibbs sampler with known stationary distribution and faster convergence. },

  Abstract                 = {Democracy has been defined and measured in various ways. This article argues that combining two basic dimensions of democracy - competition and participation - can yield a theoretically satisfactory measurement of democracy that employs three measures: degree of electoral competition, degree of electoral participation and a combined index of democratization. These variables have been used in the author's previous comparative studies of democracy. The new dataset combines previous data and extends these to cover the period 1810-1998. That dataset includes 187 contemporary and former independent states from the year 1810 or from the year of independence. In the dataset, original electoral and other political data needed to calculate the values of Competition and Participation variables are given and documented separately for each country. The values of the three variables are calculated and given for each year over the period of comparison. Finally, the new dataset is compared with the Polity98 measures of democracy and the combined Freedom House ratings of political rights and civil liberties.},

  Abstract                 = {Scholars have worked either on civil society or on ethnic conflict, but no systematic attempt has yet been made to connect the two. In an attempt to explore the possible links, this article makes two interconnected arguments. First, interethnic and intraethnic networks of civic engagement play very different roles in ethnic conflict. Because they build bridges and manage tensions, interethnic networks are agents of peace. But if communities are organized only along intraethnic lines and the interconnections with other communities are very weak (or do not exist), ethnic violence is then quite likely. Second, civic networks, both intra- and interethnic, can also be broken down into two other types: associational forms of engagement and everyday forms of engagement. This distinction is based on whether civic interaction is formal or not. Both forms of engagement, if robust, promote peace: contrariwise, their absence or weakness opens up space for ethnic violence. Of the two, however, the associational forms turn out to be sturdier than everyday engagement, especially when confronted with attempts by politicians to polarize the people along ethnic lines. Both arguments have significance for theories of ethnic conflict and social capital.},

  Abstract                 = {The dynamics of many social, technological and economic phenomena are driven by individual human actions, turning the quantitative understanding of human behavior into a central question of modern science. Current models of human dynamics, used from risk assessment to communications, assume that human actions are randomly distributed in time and thus well approximated by Poisson processes. Here we provide direct evidence that for five human activity patterns, such as email and letter based communications, web browsing, library visits and stock trading, the timing of individual human actions follow non-Poisson statistics, characterized by bursts of rapidly occurring events separated by long periods of inactivity. We show that the bursty nature of human behavior is a consequence of a decision based queuing process: when individuals execute tasks based on some perceived priority, the timing of the tasks will be heavy tailed, most tasks being rapidly executed, while a few experiencing very long waiting times. In contrast, priority blind execution is well approximated by uniform interevent statistics. We discuss two queueing models that capture human activity. The first model assumes that there are no limitations on the number of tasks an individual can hadle at any time, predicting that the waiting time of the individual tasks follow a heavy tailed distribution P(w) ??? ??? w with = 3/2. The second model imposes limitations on the queue length, resulting in a heavy tailed waiting time distribution characterized by = 1. We provide empirical evidence supporting the relevance of these two models to human activity patterns, showing that while emails, web browsing and library visitation display = 1, the surface mail based communication belongs to the = 3/2 universality class. Finally, we discuss possible extension of the proposed queueing models and outline some future challenges in exploring the statistical mechanisms of human dynamics. These findings have important implications not only for our quantitative understanding of human activity patterns, but also for resource management and service allocation in both communications and retail.},

  Abstract                 = {To date, several methods exist in the statistical literature for model assessment, which purport themselves specifically as Bayesian predictive methods. The decision theoretic assumptions on which these methods are based are not always clearly stated in the original articles, however. The aim of this survey is to provide a unified review of Bayesian predictive model assessment and selection methods, and of methods closely related to them. We review the various assumptions that are made in this context and discuss the connections between different approaches, with an emphasis on how each method approximates the expected utility of using a Bayesian model for the purpose of predicting future data.},

  Abstract                 = { ABSTRACT I use the nuclear proliferation regime to show that dyadic diplomacy is not necessarily incompatible with the building of a multilateral regime; bilateralism is not the opposite of multilateralism, but an efficient component thereof. Although this point will not be new to most students of institutions, no general rationale has so far been offered on the complementarity of bilateral and multilateral diplomacy. Starting from a characterization of proliferation as the result of a large number of prisoner's dilemmas played out between states engaged in local dyadic rivalries, I demonstrate that it is possible for the superpowers to design an optimal mix of threats and bribes in which states with low compliance costs join the regime on the terms of the multilateral treaty alone; states with intermediate compliance costs need additional customized incentives, delivered through bilateral agreements; and states with high compliance costs are not only left out of the regime but also punished for nonparticipation. I draw a few comparative statics that I systematically test on Nuclear Proliferation Treaty (NPT) membership data. I discuss the applicability of the model to the currency, trade, and aid regimes. },

  Abstract                 = {This article introduces a special issue on the micro-level dynamics of mass violent conflict. While most analyses of conflict typically adopt a regional, national or global perspective, often using country-level data, this special issue takes an explicit micro-level approach, focusing on the behaviour and welfare of individuals, households and groups or communities. At a fundamental level, conflict originates from individuals' behaviour and their repeated interactions with their surroundings, in other words, from its micro-foundations. A micro-level approach advances our understanding of conflict by its ability to account for individual and group heterogeneity within one country or one conflict. The contributors to this special issue investigate the nature of violence against civilians, the agency of civilians during conflict, the strategic interaction between civilians and armed actors, the consequences of displacement, the effectiveness of coping strategies and the impact of policy interventions. The core message from these articles is that in order to understand conflict dynamics and its effects on society, we have to take seriously the incentives and constraints shaping the interaction between the civilian population and the armed actors. The kind of interaction that develops, as well as the resulting conflict dynamics, depend on the type of conflict, the type of armed actors and the characteristics of the civilian population and its institutions.},

In this paper we investigate the dynamics of Wikipedia, a prominent, thriving wiki. We make three contributions. First, we introduce a new exploratory data analysis tool, the history flow visualization, which is effective in revealing patterns within the wiki context and which we believe will be useful in other collaborative situations as well. Second, we discuss several collaboration patterns highlighted by this visualization tool and corroborate them with statistical analysis. Third, we discuss the implications of these patterns for the design and governance of online collaborative social spaces. We focus on the relevance of authorship, the value of community surveillance in ameliorating antisocial behavior, and how authors with competing perspectives negotiate their differences.},

The model is applied to a novel dataset containing information about the store configurations of all US regional shopping centers and estimated using a new econometric approach that is robust to multiple equilibria.

  Abstract                 = {Since, at least, the Persian Gulf War, states have behaved \&ldquo;as if\&rdquo; it is costly to be unsuccessful in acquiring the legitimacy the UN Security Council confers on uses of force. This observation is puzzling for theories that seek the origins of modern institutional legitimacy in legalities or moral values. I argue that when governments and citizens look for an authority to legitimize the use of force, they generally do not seek an independent judgment on the appropriateness of an intervention but political reassurance about the consequences of proposed military adventures. Council decisions legitimize or delegitimize uses of force in the sense that they form widely accepted political judgments on whether uses of force transgress a limit that should be defended. These judgments become focal points in the collaboration and coordination dilemmas states face in enforcing limits to U.S. power while preserving mutually beneficial cooperation. In this article, I discuss the implications for the Council\&apos;s legitimacy and theories of international legitimacy.Earlier versions of this article were presented at the 2003 International Studies Association Conference, Portland, Ore., 1 March; the 2003 Annual Meetings of the American Political Science Association, Philadelphia, 29 August; Columbia University International Politics Series, New York, 29 September 2003; and the Olin Institute for Strategic Studies at Harvard University, Cambridge, 6 October 2003.

  Abstract                 = {The United States finds itself increasingly isolated in multilateral organizations. To infer what this trend signifies, we need to disentangle changes in the agenda from changes in revealed preferences. This paper does so with a novel data set, important votes in the United Nations according to the State Department, and method, a multilevel item-response model estimated by MCMC methods. The results show that the agenda becomes more negative for the United States after 1996, whereas the almost universal widening of the preference gap occurs at a constant rate between 1991 and 2001. In addition, there is no evidence for an increasing clash of civilizations and some evidence that the gap with states that become more liberal has increased less.},

  Abstract                 = { ABSTRACT I examine if and how a superpower can use its asymmetric power to achieve favorable outcomes in multilateral bargaining between states that have conflicting interests and veto power. Using a game-theoretic framework, I show that the ability to act outside, either unilaterally or with an ally, helps the superpower to reach agreements that would be vetoed in the absence of the outside option. These agreements, however, are usually not at the superpower&rsquo;s ideal point. Under some conditions, uncertainty about the credibility of the outside option can lead to unilateral action that all actors prefer to avoid. In other circumstances, this uncertainty results in multilateral actions that the superpower (and the ally) would not initiate without multilateral authorization. The model provides useful insights that help explain patterns of decision-making in the United Nations Security Council in the 1990s, including the failed attempt to reach agreement over the Kosovo intervention. },

  Abstract                 = { Since the end of the Cold War, scholars of international politicshave searched for paradigms that can make powerful and parsimoniousclaims about conflict and cooperation in post&ndash;Cold War globalpolitics.According to some, the everlasting struggle between rich andpoor countries has become the dominant division in world politics,meaning that the old North-South cleavage has superseded the Cold WarEast-West division. Others argue that global conflict has becomedominated by clashes between different civilizations or that thedominant mode of conflict in global politics is between liberaldemocracies and nondemocracies. Still others discern the rise of acounterhegemonic bloc of states seeking to challenge the dominant powerof the United States. One could argue that all of these views arecorrect on specific issues but that in general there is no singledimension that can explain global conflict since the end of the Cold War.},

  Abstract                 = {Can international judges be relied upon to resolve disputes impartially? If not, what are the sources of their biases? Answers to these questions are critically important for the functioning of an emerging international judiciary, yet we know remarkably little about international judicial behavior. An analysis of a new dataset of dissents in the European Court of Human Rights (ECtHR) yields a mixed set of answers. On the bright side, there is no evidence that judges systematically employ cultural or geopolitical biases in their rulings. There is some evidence that career insecurities make judges more likely to favor their national government when it is a party to a dispute. Most strongly, the evidence suggests that international judges are policy seekers. Judges vary in their inclination to defer to member states in the implementation of human rights. Moreover, judges from former socialist countries are more likely to find violations against their own government and against other former socialist governments, suggesting that they are motivated by rectifying a particular set of injustices. I conclude that the overall picture is mostly positive for the possibility of impartial review of government behavior by judges on an international court. Like judges on domestic review courts, ECtHR judges are politically motivated actors in the sense that they have policy preferences on how to best apply abstract human rights in concrete cases, not in the sense that they are using their judicial power to settle geopolitical scores.},

This article analyzes why state legislatures delegated advisory and policy-forming powers to bureaucracies for the Aid to Families with Dependent Children (AFDC) program from 1935 through 1996. The analysis supports various theories of bureaucratic discretion, while painting a complex political picture of delegation decisions. Legislators rely on bureaucrats to resolve uncertainty, especially when internal legislative information is scarce. Contrary to recent wisdom, however, delegation is not found to be associated with the general condition of unified government. Rather, delegation occurs under both divided and unified government, but the procedures chosen and appointment powers granted vary under these two conditions.},

  Abstract                 = {Political economists have modeled attempts by politicians to form and empower bureaucracies. Some of these models demonstrate that delegation is greater under unified government. Scholars might expect that discretion would thus decline under divided government. However, legislators who attempt to limit executive agency discretion under divided government face the threat or use of an executive veto. This article expands previous formal models of discretion to include status quo policies and levels of discretion, various agency preferences, and the possibility of an executive veto, in order to determine the level of bureaucratic discretion chosen in a separation of powers system. Three main findings emerge: (1) given certain status quo conditions and preference arrangements, discretion can be increased or decreased under either divided or unified government; (2) executive agencies are more likely to receive discretion under unified government, but independent agencies are more likely to receive discretion under divided government; and (3) there exists an asymmetry between politicians' ability to expand bureaucratic discretion and their ability to restrict discretion.},

  Abstract                 = { ABSTRACT We present a model of learning and policy choice across governments. Governments choose policies with known ideological positions but initially unknown valence benefits, possibly learning about those benefits between the model's two periods. There are two variants of the model; in one, governments only learn from their own experiences, whereas in the other they learn from one another's experiments. Based on similarities between these two versions, we illustrate that much accepted scholarly evidence of policy diffusion could simply have arisen through independent actions by governments that only learn from their own experiences. However, differences between the game-theoretic and decision-theoretic models point the way to future empirical tests that discern learning-based policy diffusion from independent policy adoptions. },

  Abstract                 = {Scholarship on intergovernmental organizations (IGOs) has mushroomed, especially studies involving quantitative analyses of state involvement in IGOs and the effects of IGOs on the behavior of state members. Yet, little of that literature enumerates IGOs using conceptually based definitions of what are formal intergovernmental organizations. Here, the authors develop a new database on IGOs, based on a definition focusing on three dimensions: formal organizations that demonstrate ongoing decisionmaking and oversight by states; evidence bureaucratic organization; and demonstrate organizational autonomy. The authors conceptualize these organizations as FIGOs. Using these dimensions, they identify the population of FIGOs at three points in time: 1975, 1989, and 2004. In addition, they generate data on state membership in FIGOs, offering not only a simple frequency of number of organizations in which a state participates, but also another measure of state involvement through the creation of a denominator of `opportunity', allowing for an analysis of the number of organizations joined versus the number of organizations a state is capable of joining. Finally, the authors compare the results from their efforts with the IGO COW database and suggest some advantages to using their data for a number of theoretical questions.},

The systematic comparison shows that all three approaches have their particular strengths and weaknesses. As a rule, the strength of one approach is the weakness of the others and vice versa. Therefore, the three approaches are not opposed to one another but complementary, so that all three are necessary for future research.},

What began more than sixty years ago as a modest proposal that a mathematician and an economist write a short paper together blossomed, in 1944, when Princeton University Press published Theory of Games and Economic Behavior. In it, John von Neumann and Oskar Morgenstern conceived a groundbreaking mathematical theory of economic and social organization, based on a theory of games of strategy. Not only would this revolutionize economics, but the entirely new field of scientific inquiry it yielded--game theory--has since been widely used to analyze a host of real-world phenomena from arms races to optimal policy choices of presidential candidates, from vaccination policy to major league baseball salary negotiations. and it is today established throughout both the social sciences and a wide range of other sciences. This sixtieth anniversary edition includes not only the original text but also an introduction by Harold Kuhn, an afterword by Ariel Rubinstein, and reviews and articles on the book that appeared at the time of its original publication in the New York Times, tthe American Economic Review, and a variety of other publications. Together, these writings provide readers a matchless opportunity to more fully appreciate a work whose influence will yet resound for generations to come.},

The tests are directional and are derived successively for the cases where the competing models are non-nested, overlapping, or nested and whether both, one, or neither is misspecified. As a prerequisite, we fully characterize the asymptotic distribution of the likelihood ratio statistic under the most general conditions. We show that it is a weighted sum of chi-square distribution or a normal distribution depending on whether the distributions in the competing models closest to the truth are observationally identical. We also propose a test of this latter condition.},

Thus to explain why wars occur one must explain why states must fight before reaching agreement, which implies that war must be considered part of the bargaining process that leads to a negotiated settlement and not as an alternative to it. However, most attempts to explain the occurrence of war assume that it is entirely the result of a choice made before it begins. I show that this way of posing the problem can only lead to misleading conclusions by analyzing a model in which a negotiated settlement remains possible after war starts.},

Moreover, some common definitions of imply behavior that is inconsistent with the behavior of states during the cold war. This article argues that the distinctive feature of post World War II international politics was not that two states were more powerful than the others, as the literature on bipolarity would suggest, but that one state, the Soviet Union, occupied in peacetime a position of near-dominance on the Eurasian continent, a position that states in the past had been able to achieve only after a series of military victories. This fact explains the behavior that others have sought to explain by bipolarity, as well as behavior that is inconsistent with what common definitions of bipolarity would lead us to expect. The article concludes with a discussion of the implications of the argument for structural theories of international politics and controversies about what lies ahead.},

As part of this discussion we examine: (1) how fundamental graphic tools have become to the scientist, (2) three instances where modern views of graphics are unchanged since Playfair's time, and (3) one area where there has been a change. The paper concludes with a discussion of five important areas of current and future graphic concern.},

  Abstract                 = {This paper analyzes and compares different ways of assessing how people perceived impending threats of war in the past. Conventional Nordic historiography of World War II claims there were few, if any, people in the Nordic countries who perceived a significantly increased threat of war between 1938 and early 1940. At the same time, historical methods face problems when it comes to capturing the often tacitly held beliefs of a large number of people in the past. In this paper, we analyze these assessments by looking at sudden shifts in sovereign debt yields and spreads in the Nordic bond markets at that time. Our results suggest that Nordic contemporaries indeed perceived significant war risk increases around the time of major war-related geopolitical events. While these findings question some--but not all--of standard Nordic World War II historiography, they also demonstrate the value of analyzing historical market prices to reassess the often tacitly held views and opinions of large groups of people in the past.},

  Abstract                 = {The early 1940s marked a period in which the consensus norms of the Supreme Court experienced a radical and apparently permanent change. The consistent pattern of relatively high cohesion characteristic of the Court's earlier years gave way to surging rates of concurring and dissenting opinions. The present research is an examination of the factors possibly contributing to the justices' sharply increasing tendency to express their individual views rather than to defer to the opinion of the Court. Using both historical and quantitative methods, the authors evaluate the impact of the Court's discretionary jurisdiction, changing caseload, associate justice characteristics, and judicial leadership. The evidence presented points to the conclusion that in combination with other factors the leadership style introduced by Harlan Fiske Stone in 1941 had a dramatic effect on the consensus norms of the Court.},

  Abstract                 = {In this paper we apply a recently-developed statistical model that explicitly accounts for the extreme uncertainty surrounding film returns. The conditional distribution of box-office returns is analyzed using the stable distribution regression model. The regression coefficients in this model represent what is known about the correlates of film success while at the same time permitting the variance of film success at the box office to be infinite. The empirical analysis shows that the conditional distribution of film returns has infinite variance, and this invalidates statistical inferences from the often-applied least-squares regression model. The estimates of the stable regression confirm some earlier results on the statistics of the movie business and the analysis demonstrates how to model box-office success in the movie business where ``nobody knows anything''},

  Abstract                 = {This article attempts to explain why some countries experience civil wars while others do not. It argues that renewed war is likely to have less to do with the attributes of a previous war, as many people have argued, than with current incentives individual citizens have to rejoin a rebel group. Civil wars will have little chance to get off the ground unless individual farmers, shopkeepers, and potential workers choose to enlist in the rebel armies that are necessary to pursue a war, and enlistment is only likely to be attractive when two conditions hold. The first is a situation of individual hardship or severe dissatisfaction with one's current situation. The second is the absence of any nonviolent means for change. An analysis of all civil wars ending between 1945 and 1996 suggests that a higher quality of life and greater access to political participation have a significant negative effect on the likelihood of renewed war. Countries that provide higher levels of economic well-being to their citizenry and create an open political system are less likely to experience multiple civil wars regardless of what happened in a previous conflict.},

  Abstract                 = { We show that the butterfly ballot used in Palm Beach County, Florida, in the 2000 presidential election caused more than 2,000 Democratic voters to vote by mistake for Reform candidate Pat Buchanan, a number larger than George W. Bush&rsquo;s certified margin of victory in Florida. We use multiple methods and several kinds of data to rule out alternative explanations for the votes Buchanan received in Palm Beach County. Among 3,053 U.S. counties where Buchanan was on the ballot, Palm Beach County has the most anomalous excess of votes for him. In Palm Beach County, Buchanan&rsquo;s proportion of the vote on election-day ballots is four times larger than his proportion on absentee (nonbutterfly) ballots, but Buchanan&rsquo;s proportion does not differ significantly between election-day and absentee ballots in any other Florida county. Unlike other Reform candidates in Palm Beach County, Buchanan tended to receive election-day votes in Democratic precincts and from individuals who voted for the Democratic U.S. Senate candidate. Robust estimation of overdispersed binomial regression models underpins much of the analysis. },

  Abstract                 = {Recent advances in Exponential Random Graph Models (ERGMs), or p* models, include new specifications that give a much better chance of model convergence for large networks compared with the traditional Markov models. Simulation based MCMC maximum likelihood estimation techniques have been developed to replace the pseudolikelihood method. To date most work on ERGMs has focused on one-mode networks, with little done in the case of affiliation networks with two or more types of nodes. This paper proposes ERGMs for two-mode affiliation networks drawing on the recent advances for one-mode networks, including new two-mode specifications. We investigate features of the models by simulation, and compared the goodness of fit results obtained using the maximum likelihood and pseudolikelihood approaches. We introduce a new approach to goodness of fit for network models, using a heuristic based on Mahalanobis distance. The classic Southern Women data and Australian Interlocking Director data are used as examples to show that the ERGM with the newly specified statistics is a powerful tool for statistical analysis of affiliation networks.},

  Abstract                 = {Many previous studies assessed the effectiveness of U.S. foreign aid by focusing on voting coincidence rates of allUN votes and found no relationship between U.S. aid distribution and UN voting coincidence rates. Most UN resolutions, however, are simply not important enough for the U.S. to expend its scarce resources in influencing the outcomes. The U.S. government would not be likely to exercise pressure on all UN resolutions but would do so on issues considered vital to America's national interests. If there is any effect from receiving U.S. foreign aid on political outcomes in the UN, it is therefore most likely to emerge in voting coincidence rates on important issues. Using data collected for sixty-five developing countries between 1984 and 1993, a pooled cross-sectional and time-series research design is adopted to examine this hypothesis. Contrary to the argument that foreign aid is an ineffective policy instrument in the pursuit of America's global influence, the currentfindings suggest that the U.S. government has successfully utilized foreign aid programs to induce foreign policy compliance in the UN on issues that are vital to America's national interests.},

  Abstract                 = {Large-n studies of conflict have produced a large number of statistically significant results but little accurate guidance in terms of anticipating the onset of conflict. The authors argue that too much attention has been paid to finding statistically significant relationships, while too little attention has been paid to finding variables that improve our ability to predict civil wars. The result can be a distorted view of what matters most to the onset of conflict. Although these models may not be intended to be predictive models, prescriptions based on these models are generally based on statistical significance, and the predictive attributes of the underlying models are generally ignored. These predictions should not be ignored, but rather need to be heuristically evaluated because they may shed light on the veracity of the models. In this study, the authors conduct a side-by-side comparison of the statistical significance and predictive power of the different variables used in two of the most influential models of civil war. The results provide a clear demonstration of how potentially misleading the traditional focus on statistical significance can be. Until out-of-sample heuristics — especially including predictions — are part of the normal evaluative tools in conflict research, we are unlikely to make sufficient theoretical progress beyond broad statements that point to GDP per capita and population as the major causal factors accounting for civil war onset.},

  Abstract                 = {The authors examine a standard gravity model of international commerce augmented to include political as well as institutional influences on bilateral trade. Using annual data from 1980-2001, they estimate regression coefficients and residual dependencies using a hierarchy of models in each year. Rather than gauge the generalizability of these patterns via traditional measures of statistical significance such as p-values, this article develops and employs a strategy to evaluate the out-of-sample predictive strength of various models. The analysis of recent international commerce shows that in addition to a typical gravity-model specification, political and institutional variables are important. The article also demonstrates that the often-reported link between international conflict and bilateral trade is elusive, and that inclusion of conflict in a trade model can sometimes lead to reduced out-of-sample predictive performance. Further, this article illustrates that there are substantial, persistent residual exporter- and importer-specific effects, and that ignoring such patterns in relational trade data results in an incomplete picture of international commerce, even in the context of a well-established framework such as the gravity model.},

  Abstract                 = {<p>Developing political forecasting models not only increases the ability of political scientists to inform public policy decisions, but is also relevant for scientific advancement. As part of a larger project, a team at Duke University created a series of geographically informed statistical models for conflict prediction. The generated predictions have been highly accurate, with few false negative and positive categorizations. Predictions are made at the monthly level for six months periods into the future, taking into account the social-spatial context of each individual country. The model has a high degree of accuracy in reproducing historical data measured monthly over the past 10 years, and is approximately equally accurate in making \&nbsp;forecasts. This paper surveys the notion of forecasting and demonstrates the utility of creating forecasting models for predicting political conflicts in a diverse range of country settings. Apart from the benefit of making actual predictions, we argue that predictive heuristics are one gold standard of model development in the field of conflict studies and thatthe predictive heuristics shed light on an array of \&nbsp;important components of the political science literature on conflict dynamics.</p>},

  Abstract                 = {Militarized interstate disputes are widely thought to be less likely among democratic countries that have high levels of trade and extensive participation in international organizations. We reexamine this broad finding of the Kantian peace literature in the context of a model that incorporates the high degree of dependency among countries. Based on in-sample statistical tests, as well as out-of-sample, predictive cross-validation, we find that results frequently cited in the literature are plagued by overfitting and cannot be characterized as identifying the underlying structure through which international conflict is influenced by democracy, trade, and international governmental organizations. We conclude that much of the statistical association typically reported in this literature apparently stems from three components: (1) geographical proximity, (2) dependence among militarized interstate disputes with the same initiator or target, and (3) the higher-order dependencies in these dyadic data. Once these are incorporated, covariates associated with the Kantian peace tripod lose most of their statistical power. We do find that higher levels of joint democracy are associated with lower probabilities of militarized interstate dispute involvement. We find that despite high statistical significance and putative substantive importance, none of the variables representing the Kantian tripod is associated with any substantial degree of predictive power.},

  Abstract                 = {The topic of authority only rarely figures into theories of deliberative democracy, no doubt owing to the widely held view that authority is inherently undemocratic. But deliberative democrats need a concept of authoritative decision making, not least because the scale and complexity of contemporary societies radically limit the numbers of decisions that can be made by deliberatively democratic means. I argue for an inherently democratic conception of authority, in large part by examining and rejecting the view--held by radical democrats, conservatives, and most liberals--that authority involves a surrender of judgment by those subject to authority. In contrast, I develop the view that authority, particularly in posttraditional contexts, involves a limited suspension of judgment enabled by a context of democratic challenge and public accountability. An important point is that democratic authority supports robust deliberative decision making by enabling individuals to allocate their time, energy, and knowledge to the issues most significant to them.},

  Abstract                 = {This paper makes two separate, but interrelated, claims. The first is that interstate military alliances should be conceptualized not only as a means to credibly reveal pre-existing interests, but also as tools that are used by states to construct interests through the generation of mutual expectations. The second is that accurate statistical modeling of such alliances requires that researchers escape the assumptions of dyadic independence built into nearly every statistical tool (logit, probit, proportional hazards, etc.) currently used by international relations scholars. The use of stochastic actor-oriented models, combined with Markov simulations of network evolution, is shown to be a productive alternative method of modeling international alliances, which allows the researcher to incorporate theory-driven assumptions about patterns of dyadic interdependence directly into the functional form of the statistical model},

  Abstract                 = {In regular statistical models, the leave-one-out cross-validation is asymptotically equivalent to the Akaike information criterion. However, since many learning machines are singular statistical models, the asymptotic behavior of the cross-validation remains unknown. In previous studies, we established the singular learning theory and proposed a widely applicable information criterion, the expectation value of which is asymptotically equal to the average Bayes generalization loss. In the present paper, we theoretically compare the Bayes cross-validation loss and the widely applicable information criterion and prove two theorems. First, the Bayes cross-validation loss is asymptotically equivalent to the widely applicable information criterion as a random variable. Therefore, model selection and hyperparameter optimization using these two values are asymptotically equivalent. Second, the sum of the Bayes generalization error and the Bayes cross-validation error is asymptotically equal to 2 λ/n, where λ is the real log canonical threshold and n is the number of training samples. Therefore the relation between the cross-validation error and the generalization error is determined by the algebraic geometrical structure of a learning machine. We also clarify that the deviance information criteria are diﬀerent from the Bayes cross-validation and the widely applicable information criterion.},

Here we explore simple models of networks that can be tuned through this middle ground: regular networks ???rewired??? to introduce increasing amounts of disorder. We find that these systems can be highly clustered, like regular lattices, yet have small characteristic path lengths, like random graphs. We call them ???small-world??? networks, by analogy with the small-world phenomenon13,14 (popularly known as six degrees of separation15). The neural network of the worm Caenorhabditis elegans, the power grid of the western United States, and the collaboration graph of film actors are shown to be small-world networks. Models of dynamical systems with small-world coupling display enhanced signal-propagation speed, computational power, and synchronizability. In particular, infectious diseases spread more easily in small-world networks than in regular lattices.},

  Abstract                 = {The documentation of treatment outcomes has gained increased importance as those responsible for paying for healthcare focus on the delivery of cost-effective care. The practitioner and researcher, challenged with documenting the clinical significance of their endeavors, must depend on conceptually appropriate, valid and reliable instruments. Outcomes of particular relevance for sleep disorders include self-reported general symptoms, subjective and objective daytime sleepiness, neurobehavior, health-related quality of life (HRQL) or functional status, incidence of accidents and cardiovascular morbidity, and health care utilization and cost. This paper will limit its focus to the outcomes of self-reported general symptoms, subjective and objective daytime sleepiness, and HRQL or functional status. In addition to describing measures that could be applied to evaluate these outcomes, this paper will also discuss factors affecting the selection of outcome measures for use in research and practice, and consider evidence generated with the application of these instruments in research. Reductions in self-reported symptoms, such as snoring and daytime hypersomnolence following treatment, have been documented with the application of measures with strong psychometric properties such as the Survey Screen for Sleep Apnea and Epworth Sleepiness Scale. In addition to statistical reliability, calculation of the effect size and standardized response mean indicate that these changes are also clinically meaningful. Similar improvements have also been demonstrated using the Multiple Sleep Latency Test (MSLT), although the resulting increased latency has not typically been within normal values. Important improvements following treatment have been documented with the Maintenance of Wakefulness Test (MWT). Evidence suggests that the MWT may be more sensitive in situations, such as narcolepsy, where there are high levels of physiologic sleepiness, reserving the MSLT where the physiologic sleep tendency is more restricted, such as in obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). Patients perceptions of the benefit of treatment to their daily lives have been documented by such generic measures of HRQL, such as the SF-36 and Nottingham Health Profile. However, the impact of sleep disorders and the benefit of treatment on those aspects of daily behavior likely to be most affected have more clearly been demonstrated with the utilization of disease-specific HRQL measures such as the Functional Outcomes of Sleep Questionnaire and the Calgary Sleep Apnea Quality of Life Index. 2001 Harcourt Publishers Ltd},

This is the first self-report measure designed to assess the impact of disorders of excessive sleepiness (DOES) on multiple activities of everyday living. Three samples were used in the development and psychometric analyses of the FOSQ: Sample 1 (n = 153) consisted of individuals seeking medical attention for a sleep problem and persons of similar age and gender having no sleep disorder; samples 2 (n = 24) and 3 (n = 51) were composed of patients from two medical centers diagnosed with obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). Factor analysis of the FOSQ yielded five factors: activity level, vigilance, intimacy and sexual relationships, general productivity, and social outcome. Internal reliability was excellent for both the subscales (alpha = 0.86 to alpha = 0.91) and the total scale (alpha = 0.95). Test-retest reliability of the FOSQ yielded coefficients ranging from r = 0.81 to r = 0.90 for the five subscales and r = 0.90 for the total measure. The FOSQ successfully discriminated between normal subjects and those seeking medical attention for a sleep problem (T157 = -5.88, p = 0.0001). This psychometric evaluation of the FOSQ demonstrated parameters acceptable for its application in research and in clinical practice to measure functional status outcomes for persons with DOES. Thus, the FOSQ can be used to determine how disorders of excessive sleepiness affect patients' abilities to conduct normal activities and the extent to which these abilities are improved by effective treatment of DOES.},

  Abstract                 = { Scholars of international relations usually argue that democracies are better able to signal their foreign policy intentions than nondemocracies, in part because democracies have an advantage in generating audience costs that make backing down in international crises costly to the leader. This article argues that the conventional hypothesis underestimates the extent to which nondemocratic leaders can be held accountable domestically, allowing them to generate audience costs. First, I identify three factors contributing to audience costs: whether domestic political groups can and will coordinate to punish the leader; whether the audience views backing down negatively; and whether outsiders can observe the possibility of domestic sanctions for backing down. The logic predicts that democracies should have no audience costs advantage over autocracies when elites can solve their coordination dilemma, and the possibility of coordination is observable to foreign decision makers. Empirical tests show that democracies do not in fact have a significant signaling advantage over most autocracies. This finding has important implications for understanding the relationship between regime type and international relations.},

  Abstract                 = {Many states that formed the Southern Confederacy defaulted on sovereign debt sold in international capital markets during the 1840s. The Confederacy also elected President Jefferson Davis, who openly advocated the repudiation of U.S. states' debts while a member of Congress. Despite its poor credit record, the Confederate government managed to float cotton bonds in England that constituted under 2\% of its expenditures. The bonds were largely issued to settle overdue debts with gun contractors who had cut off trade credit. The South serviced the bonds as late as March 1865, a time of domestic hyperinflation and weeks before the fall of Richmond. Although the Confederate experience shows that trade sanctions can promote debt repayment, the gunboat model can only account for a small amount of lending. A reputation or another type of sanction would be necessary to support higher levels of lending in international capital markets.},

  Abstract                 = {This article investigates the determinants of Confederate cotton bond prices during the American Civil War. Specifically, this study examines the more than doubling of cotton bond prices between December 1863 and September 1864, even after critical defeats of Southern armies at Gettysburg and Vicksburg in the summer of 1863. A vector autoregression analysis of the war debt prices indicates that an increase in the price of cotton can largely account for the large upward movement in cotton bond prices during this period. The ability to convert the war bonds into cotton provided investors insurance that hedged against war risk. },

  Abstract                 = {What drives leaders’ decisions about whether to continue or end an ongoing war? The private
information explanation for war holds that leaders fight because they believe that doing so will
advance national interests, and settle when new information reduces their optimism about the
possibility of long-term success. Yet significant theoretical disagreement exists about both the
extent to which and the manner in which new information, especially battlefield information,
promotes settlement. This article unpacks the logic of the informational mechanism, arguing
that settlement will be more likely when there has been more extensive fighting and that countries
are more likely to make concessions to end wars when battlefield results have deteriorated;
short-term spikes in war intensity by contrast do not promote settlement. Moreover, building on
work on leadership turnover and settlement, I show that leader replacement is sometimes part
of the information updating process, especially in autocracies: new leaders without political ties
to the person in power at the start of the war are more likely both to come to power when
war is going poorly and to end wars once in office. Tests of these arguments make use of new
participant-level data on the timing of battle deaths for all Correlates of War interstate wars,
which allows me to examine the effects of changing battlefield developments across a wide range
of cases in a manner that was previously impossible.}

  Abstract                 = {Doubt has recently been cast on the applicability of mathematical models in general and Lanchester-type equations in particular to real combat. A comparatively small amount of effort has been spent in the past in testing theory against data, and so the general validity of such modeling largely remains to be demonstrated. In this paper, combat data on the U.S. Civil War is examined to determine the extent to which it can be explained by simple mathematical relations, and some support, as well as problems, for such modeling is developed. A model for probability of winning is developed, depending solely on the ability of each force to continue to fight after sustaining specified fractional losses. Distributions of parameters describing battles, force ratios, and loss ratios are derived. Limited applicability of Lanchester-type equations is indicated. It is concluded that although these hundred-year-old battles may have limited application to future combat, the possibilities of deriving improved combat models by analyzing real life data are essentially unlimited, and that fact differs sufficiently from theory to make it unlikely that pure conjecture will hit upon the proper form for a combat model structure.},

  Abstract                 = {Once a war has been initiated, its continuation or termination may be considered to be determined by two transition probabilities-one describing the probability that in a small interval of time an additional death occurs, and the other describing the probability that in the same small interval of time the war is terminated. Given forms for these transition probabilities, one may obtain distribution functions for the duration and magnitude of a war, given that it has begun. The inverse problem of determining the form of the transition probabilities, given the distribution of war durations and magnitudes, is more difficult. However, functions are developed in this paper that will generate distributions corresponding to those presented in the tabulation of 315 wars prepared by L. F. Richardson. The expressions for the transition probabilities are derived based on the assumption that they depend at each instant only as the cumulative number of deaths to that point and the time over which the deaths have been incurred. Some of the implications of the expressions and the possibility of their use to categorize classes of wars are discussed.},

  Abstract                 = {Summary A distributed lag model (DLagM) is a regression model that includes lagged exposure variables as covariates; its corresponding distributed lag (DL) function describes the relationship between the lag and the coefficient of the lagged exposure variable. DLagMs have recently been used in environmental epidemiology for quantifying the cumulative effects of weather and air pollution on mortality and morbidity. Standard methods for formulating DLagMs include unconstrained, polynomial, and penalized spline DLagMs. These methods may fail to take full advantage of prior information about the shape of the DL function for environmental exposures, or for any other exposure with effects that are believed to smoothly approach zero as lag increases, and are therefore at risk of producing suboptimal estimates. In this article, we propose a Bayesian DLagM (BDLagM) that incorporates prior knowledge about the shape of the DL function and also allows the degree of smoothness of the DL function to be estimated from the data. We apply our BDLagM to its motivating data from the National Morbidity, Mortality, and Air Pollution Study to estimate the short-term health effects of particulate matter air pollution on mortality from 1987 to 2000 for Chicago, Illinois. In a simulation study, we compare our Bayesian approach with alternative methods that use unconstrained, polynomial, and penalized spline DLagMs. We also illustrate the connection between BDLagMs and penalized spline DLagMs. Software for fitting BDLagM models and the data used in this article are available online.},

  Abstract                 = {How do we explain the wide variation in the terms of settlement that end wars? One possibility is that the terms of settlement merely reflect the belligerents' original aims. A second possibility is that the final terms arise out of negotiations to terminate the war and reflect each side's evaluation of the costs and political risks of continuing the war. The author tests hypotheses derived from both perspectives using ordered logit regression in the period 1816-1980. The results generally support both the aims and the bargaining hypotheses. In contrast, the author finds that the belligerents' regime type does not affect the final terms. The author concludes that belligerents generally use the bargaining leverage they have to demand as much as possible and to concede as little as possible, but their original aims can affect their bargaining leverage by increasing the political risks of continuing the war past a certain point.},

  Abstract                 = { ABSTRACT Recent efforts to explain why some peace agreements last while others fail have focused on the strength of the agreement itself. Maintaining peace, even if both belligerents want peace, can be difficult if there are temptations to defect or there are reasons to fear that one may be played for the sucker. Strong agreements that can increase the costs of defection, enhance monitoring, or reward cooperation help to solve this enforcement dilemma and generally increase the former belligerents&apos; incentives to remain at peace. Although we agree that such carrots and sticks can facilitate cooperation, we argue in this article that such measures will often be inadequate if the belligerents themselves are no longer committed to keeping the peace. If the belligerents believe that a renewed war can lead to better terms, peace will be precarious. We demonstrate that getting (and keeping) the terms right may be more important than any carrots and sticks incorporated into the document to enforce those terms. In particular, we show that âunnaturalâ ceasefires that come about as a consequence of third-party pressure are significantly more likely to fail. We also show that ceasefires negotiated after wars with consistent battle outcomes are more likely to last than those where the ârightâ terms of settlement are less apparent.We would like to thank Virginia Page Fortna, Dani Reiter, Nicholas Sambanis, and the anonymous reviewers and editors of International Organization for their many suggestions and insightful comments on previous versions of this article. },

  Abstract                 = {Motifs in a given network are small connected subnetworks that occur in significantly higher frequencies than would be expected in random networks. They have recently gathered much attention as a concept to uncover structural design principles of complex networks. Kashtan et al. [Bioinformatics, 2004] proposed a sampling algorithm for performing the computationally challenging task of detecting network motifs. However, among other drawbacks, this algorithm suffers from a sampling bias and scales poorly with increasing subgraph size. Based on a detailed analysis of the previous algorithm, we present a new algorithm for network motif detection which overcomes these drawbacks. Furthermore, we present an efficient new approach for estimating the frequency of subgraphs in random networks that, in contrast to previous approaches, does not require the explicit generation of random networks. Experiments on a testbed of biological networks show our new algorithms to be orders of magnitude faster than previous approaches, allowing for the detection of larger motifs in bigger networks than previously possible and thus facilitating deeper insight into the field.},

  Abstract                 = {Why do lower courts treat Supreme Court precedents favorably or unfavorably? To address this question, we formulate a theoretical framework based on current principal-agent models of the judiciary. We use the framework to structure an empirical analysis of a random sample of 500 Supreme Court cases, yielding over 10,000 subsequent treatments in the U.S. Courts of Appeals. When the contemporary Supreme Court is ideologically estranged from the enacting Supreme Court, lower courts treat precedent much more harshly. Controlling for the ideological distance between the enacting and contemporary Supreme Courts, the preferences of the contemporary lower court itself are unrelated to its behavior. Hence, hierarchical control appears strong and effective. At the same time, however, a lower court's previous treatments of precedent strongly influence its later treatments. The results have important implications for understanding legal change and suggest new directions for judicial principal-agency theory.},

We describe a Bayesian model that treats the change point in a time series as a parameter to be estimated. In this model, inference for the regression coefficients reflects prior uncertainty about the location of the change point. Inferences about regression coefficients, unconditional on the change-point location, can be obtained by simulation methods. The model is illustrated in an analysis of real wage growth in 18 OECD countries from 1965–1992.},

  Abstract                 = { While increased exposure to the global economy is associated with increased welfare effort in the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), the opposite holds in the developing world. These differences are typically explained with reference to domestic politics. Tradables, unions, and the like in the developing world are assumed to have less power or interests divergent to those in the OECD&mdash;interests that militate against social spending. I claim that such arguments can be complemented with a recognition that developed and developing nations have distinct patterns of integration into global markets. While income shocks associated with international markets are quite modest in the OECD, they are profound in developing nations. In the OECD, governments can respond to those shocks by borrowing on capital markets and spending countercyclically on social programs. No such opportunity exists for most governments in the developing world, most of which have limited access to capital markets in tough times, more significant incentives to balance budgets, and as a result cut social spending at the times it is most needed. Thus, while internationally inspired volatility and income shocks seem not to threaten the underpinnings of the welfare state in rich nations, it undercuts the capacity of governments in the developing world to smooth consumption (and particularly consumption by the poor) across the business cycle.The author would like to thank Steph Haggard, Kristin Bakke, Wongi Choe, Tim Jones, and seminar participants at Duke University, Penn State University, Washington University, MIT, and the University of New Mexico for their helpful comments.

We provide some quantitative evidence on this question by introducing a new methodology for estimating the probability of winning a civil war or revolution based on decisions in financial markets. Using a unique dataset of Confederate gold bonds in Amsterdam, we apply this methodology to estimate the probability of a Southern victory from the summer of 1863 until the end of the war. Our results suggest that European investors gave the Confederacy approximately a 42 percent chance of victory prior to the battle of Gettysburg/Vicksburg. News of the severity of the two rebel defeats led to a sell-off in Confederate bonds. By the end of 1863, the probability of a Southern victory fell to about 15 percent. Confederate victory prospects generally decreased for the remainder of the war. The analysis also suggests that McClellanâs possible election as U.S. President on a peace party platform as well as Confederate military victories in 1864 did little to reverse the marketâs assessment that the South would probably lose the Civil War.},

The notation generalizes that of Nelder (1965). Algorithm AS 65 (Rogers, 1973) converts factorial model formulae in this notation to a list of model terms represented as binary integers. A further extension of the syntax is discussed for specifying models generally (including non-linear forms).},

Hand-drawn examples show their authors' efforts to arrange symbols so that they are as near as possible to their proper locations on a scale without overlapping enough to obscure each other. Recent computer programs that attempt to reproduce these historical plots have unfortunately resorted to simple histogram binning instead of using methods that follow the rules for the hand-drawn examples. This article introduces an algorithm that more accurately represents the dot plots cited in the literature.},

Specifically, the goal of the investigation reported here was to determine, by an examination of historical military data, the extent to which Lanchester's equations are an expression of a general property of battle. },

  Abstract                 = {A representative sample of players of a popular massively multiplayer online game (World of Warcraft) was interviewed to map out the social dynamics of guilds. An initial survey and network mapping of players and guilds helped form a baseline. Next, the resulting interview transcripts were reviewed to explore player behaviors, attitudes, and opinions; the meanings they make; the social capital they derive; and the networks they form and to develop a typology of players and guilds. In keeping with current Internet research findings, players were found to use the game to extend real-life relationships, meet new people, form relationships of varying strength, and also use others merely as a backdrop. The key moderator of these outcomes appears to be the game's mechanic, which encourages some kinds of interactions while discouraging others. The findings are discussed with respect to the growing role of code in shaping social interactions.},

  Abstract                 = {One feature of many naturally occurring or engineered complex systems is tremendous variability in event sizes. To account for it, the behavior of these systems is often described using power law relationships or scaling distributions, which tend to be viewed as "exotic" because of their unusual properties (e.g., infinite moments). An alternate view is based on mathematical, statistical, and data-analytic arguments and suggests that scaling distributions should be viewed as "more normal than normal". In support of this latter view that has been advocated by Mandelbrot for the last 40 years, we review in this paper some relevant results from probability theory and illustrate a powerful statistical approach for deciding whether the variability associated with observed event sizes is consistent with an underlying Gaussian-type (finite variance) or scaling-type (infinite variance) distribution. We contrast this approach with traditional model fitting techniques and discuss its implications for future modeling of complex systems.},

  Abstract                 = {We undertake inference for a stochastic form of the Lanchester combat model. In particular, given battle data, we assess the type of battle that occurred and whether or not it makes any difference to the number of casualties if an army is attacking or defending. Our approach is Bayesian and we use modern computational techniques to fit the model. We illustrate our method using data from the Ardennes campaign. We compare our results with previous analyses of these data by Bracken and Fricker. Our conclusions are somewhat different to those of Bracken. Where he suggests that a linear law is appropriate, we show that the logarithmic or linear-logarithmic laws fit better. We note however that the basic Lanchester modeling assumptions do not hold for the Ardennes data. Using Fricker's modified data, we show that although his âsuper-logarithmicâ law fits best, the linear, linear-logarithmic, and logarithmic laws cannot be ruled out. We suggest that Bayesian methods can be used to make inference for battles in progress. We point out a number of advantages: Prior information from experts or previous battles can be incorporated; predictions of future casualties are easily made; more complex models can be analysed using stochastic simulation techniques.},

Successful countries create conditions for high productivity in the economic sphere by enforcing property rights and providing social overhead capital and at the same time minimize political costs by creating a system of rules that reduce influence costs and allow for diverse preferences. Countries also need an effective military apparatus to protect their wealth from predation by other countries. Success in these endeavors may lead to immigration and geographical expansion, but an inability to meet these goals may lead to extensive emigration or breakup of the country. The argument is done within the context of a formal model that integrates spatial political costs with the benefits of spatially determined economic production and the effect of coercive transfers. The analysis is used to provide insight into secessions and mergers of nation-states.},

It views the termination of war as a process of rational calculations by the participants; unless both sides believe that they can be made better off by a settlement, the war will continue. An important result of this approach is that a reduction of hostilities may reduce the probability of a settlement taking place and thus prolong the war. It is also shown that increasing the probability of winning may not increase the probability of a settlement and that a country which only values the present need not be at a disadvantage in the negotiation.},

  Abstract                 = {There are 261 international rivers, covering almost one half of the total land surface of the globe, and untold numbers of shared aquifers. Water has been a cause of political tensions between Arabs and Israelis; Indians and Bangladeshis; Americans and Mexicans; and all ten riparian states of the Nile River. Water is the only scarce resource for which there is no substitute, over which there is poorly-developed international law, and the need for which is overwhelming, constant, and immediate. As a consequence, "water" and "war" are two topics being assessed together with increasing frequency. This paper investigates the reality of historic water conflict and draws lessons for the plausibility of future "water wars." The datasets of conflict are explored for those related to water -- only seven minor skirmishes are found in this century; no war has ever been fought over water. In contrast, 145 water-related treaties were signed in the same period. These treaties, collected and catalogued in a computerized database along with relevant notes from negotiators, are assessed for patterns of conflict resolution. War over water seems neither strategically rational, hydrographically effective, nor economically viable. Shared interests along a waterway seem to consistently outweigh water's conflict-inducing characteristics. Furthermore, once cooperative water regimes are established through treaty, they turn out to be impressively resilient over time, even between otherwise hostile riparians, and even as conflict is waged over other issues. These patterns suggest that the more valuable lesson of international water is as a resources whose characteristics tend to induce cooperation, and incite violence only in the exception.},

  Abstract                 = {Stanley Crawford, a former mayordomo (ditch manager) of an acequia (irrigation ditch) in New Mexico, writes of two neighbors who âhave never been on good termsâ¦the lower neighbor commonly accusing the upper of never letting any water pass downstream to his place and then of dumping trash into it whenever he rarely does.â Such rivalries over water have been the source of disputes since the Neolithic revolution, when humans settled down to cultivate food between 8000 and 6000 BC. Our language reflects these ancient roots: ârivalryâ comes from the Latin rivalis, or âone using the same river as another.â Riparians âcountries or provinces bordering the same riverâare often rivals for the water they share. Today the downstream neighborâs complaint about the upstream riparian is echoed by Syria about Turkey, Pakistan about India, and Egypt about Ethiopia. Regardless of the geographic scale or the ripariansâ relative level of economic development, the conflicts they face are remarkably similar. Sandra Postel, director of the Global Water Policy Project, describes the problem in Pillars of Sand: Water, unlike other scarce, consumable resources, is used to fuel all facets of society, from biology and economy to aesthetics and spiritual practice. Water is an integral part of ecosystems, interwoven with the soil, air, flora, and fauna. Since water flows, use of a river or aquifer in one place will affect (and be affected by) its use in another, possibly distant, place. Within watersheds, everything is connected: surface water and groundwater, quality and quantity. Water fluctuates wildly in space and time, further complicating its management, which is usually fragmented and subject to vague, arcane, or contradictory legal principles. Water cannot be managed for a single purpose: all water management serves multiple objectives and navigates among competing interests. Within a nation, these interestsâ domestic users, farmers, hydropower generators, recreational users, ecosystemsâare often at odds, and the probability of a mutually acceptable solution falls exponentially in proportion to the number of stakeholders. Add international boundaries, and the chances drop yet again. Without a mutual solution, these parties can find themselves in dispute, and even violent conflict, with each other or with state authorities. Still, water-related disputes must be considered in the broader political, ethnic, and religious context. Water is never the singleâand hardly ever the majorâ cause of conflict. But it can exacerbate existing tensions and therefore must be considered within the larger context of conflict and peace. From the Middle East to New Mexico, the problems remain the same. So, however, do many of the solutions. Human ingenuity has developed ways to address water shortages and cooperate in managing water resources. In fact, cooperative events between riparian states outnumbered conflicts by more than two to one between 1945 and 1999. In addition, water has also been a productive pathway for building confidence, developing cooperation, and preventing conflict, even in particularly contentious basins. In some cases, water provides one of the few paths for dialogue in otherwise heated bilateral conflicts. In politically unsettled regions, water is an essential part of regional development negotiations, which serve as de facto conflict-prevention strategies.},

With both physical and social variables in one database, linked by basin, hypotheses of indicators of conflict are explored, suggesting the centrality of institutions in ameliorating water disputes. On the climate side, analyses demonstrate that historically, extreme events of conflict were more frequent in marginal climates with highly variable hydrologic conditions, while the riparians of rivers with less extreme natural conditions have been more moderate in their conflict/cooperation relationship. These findings are then followed by recommendations regarding the role that universities can play to aid the international community and riparian nations in building effective institutions to manage shared water resources.},

  Abstract                 = {Despite the growing literature on water and conflict in international river basins, little empirical work has been done to bolster common conclusions which are so widely reported. In order to address this gap, we set out to assess all reported events of either conflict or cooperation between nations over water resources during the last 50 years and to use these events to inform the identification of basins at greatest risk of political stress in the near future (5-10 years). The study is divided into three components: 1. Compilation and assessment of relevant biophysical, socio-economic and geopolitical data in a global Geographic Information System (GIS), and use of these factors to determine history-based indicators for future tensions along international waterways. 2. Using these indicators, identification of basins at risk for the coming decade. 3. Identification and assessment of the potential for mitigating factors and new technologies resulting in a future different than that predicted by history-based indicators. In general, we find that most of the parameters regularly identified as indicators of water conflict are actually only weakly linked to disputes, but that institutional capacity within a basin, whether defined as water management bodies or treaties, or generally positive international relations are as important, if not more so, than the physical aspects of a system. It turns out then that very rapid changes, either on the institutional side or in the physical system, which outpace the institutional capacity to absorb that change, are at the root of most water conflict, as reflected in two sets of indicators: 1) internationalized basins, i.e. basins which include the management structures of newly independent states, and 2) basins which include unilateral development projects and the absence of cooperative regimes. By taking our parameters of rapid change as indicators internationalized basins and major planned projects in hostile and/or institution-less basins?we are able to identify the basins with settings which suggest the potential for political stresses in the coming five to ten years. These basins include: the GangesBrahmaputra, Han, Incomati, Kunene, Kura-Araks, Lake Chad, La Plata, Lempa, Limpopo, Mekong, Ob (Ertis), Okavango, Orange, Salween, Senegal, Tumen and Zambezi. We then identify red flags, or markers related to these indicators, which might be monitored in the future. Finally, recognizing that history-based indicators may lose validity over time in a rapidly changing world, we ask, ?what about the future, which may look nothing like the past, and focus on four topics: new technologies for negotiation and management; globalization, privatization and the WTO; the geopolitics of desalination; and the changing sources of water and the changing nature of conflict.},

  Review                   = {How does the expected behavior of an incumbent leaderâs successor affect bargain- ing outcomes in the present? I analyze a game-theoretic model of crisis bargaining in which (a) the distributive nature of settlements affects the probability of political survival, (b) leadership turnover implies the accession of a new leader with potentially different preferences for war, and (c) successors may renegotiate inherited settlements. Commitment problems thus arise endogenously and may be solved in one of two ways. First, incumbents otherwise willing to make large concessions may be attacked, dragged into wars by very resolute successors who will revise settlements in the future. Sec- ond, moderately resolute successors can lend bargaining power to otherwise irresolute incumbents, who can demand concessions that bolster their hold on political power. Examining leadership turnover as a commitment problem thus allows for a considera- tion of the effects of the future balance of resolve on present bargaining outcomes.},

We present the first bargaining model of war that allows for both asymmetric information and commitment problems. The model produces three striking results, all of which emerge when both asymmetric information and commitment problems are present. First, in contrast to some existing information-oriented models, the resolution of uncertainty through fighting can lead to the continuation of war rather than its termination. Second, wars are less---not more---likely to end the longer they have lasted. Third, a belligerent will increase its war aims over time as it becomes convinced that it faces an unappeasable opponent. Finally, the dynamics that characterize wars in purely asymmetric information or commitment models should exist only when the other bargaining problem is absent or trivial, a condition that may be satisfied only rarely in an anarchic international system.},

  Abstract                 = {This paper presents a finite horizon job search model that is econometrically implemented using all of the restrictions implied by the theory. Following a sample of male high school graduates from the youth cohort of the National Longitudinal Surveys from graduation to employment, search parameters such as the cost of search, the probability of receiving an offer, the discount factor, and those from the wage offer distribution are estimated. Reservation wages and offer probabilities are estimated to be quite low. Simulations are performed of the impact of the parameters on the expected duration of unemployment. For example, it is estimated that an offer probability of unity, as opposed to the estimate of approximately only one per cent per week, would reduce the expected duration of unemployment from 46 weeks to 20 weeks.},

  Abstract                 = {Recent studies have suggested that accession to GATT/WTO is a complex, difficult, and lengthy process, and such process has lengthened in recent years. Using survival analysis, we find that the applicant's political regime has a significant impact on the time it takes to accede to GATT/WTO. In particular, the accession duration is likely shorter for an applicant whose political regime is more democratic. Such a finding is also robust regardless of different econometric methods and data sets adopted. Our finding is surprising because political regime is never to be considered as a mandate of the GATT/WTO before.},

  Abstract                 = {A common assumption by time-series analysts is that the estimated coefficients remain fixed through time. Yet this strong assumption often has little grounds in substantive theory or empirical tests. If the true coefficients change over time, but are estimated with fixed-coefficient methods such as Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) or its many offshoots, then this can lead to significant information loss, as well as errors of inference. This article demonstrates a method, Flexible Least Squares (FLS), for exploring the relative stability of time-series coefficients. FLS is superior to other such methods in that it enables the analyst to diagnose the magnitude of coefficient variation and detect which particular coefficients are changing. FLS also provides an estimated vector of time-varying coefficients for exploratory or descriptive purposes. FLS properties are demonstrated through simulation analysis and an evaluation of the time-varying characteristics of explanations of presidential approval from 1978 to 1997.},

This paper reviews a number of issues having to do with potential bias and error in such data.

The model explicitly considers the risk averse behavior of investors to provide a more precise framework for estimating the implied default probability. A Kalman filter method is used to estimate time-varying risk premium associated with the investor's risk aversion. The results of nonlinear regressions indicate that previous risk-neutrality models consistently overestimate the implied default rates of corporate bonds. The results also suggest that investors may have been adequately compensated for investment in risky bonds.},

Tournament studies, ecological simulation, and theoretical analysis demonstrate (1) a generous version of tit-for-tat is a highly effective strategy when the players it meets have not adapted to noise; (2) if the other players have adapted to noise, a contrite version of tit-for-tat is even more effective at quickly restoring mutual cooperation without the risk of exploitation; and (3) Pavlov is not robust.},

The advantage of employing a statistical model instead of directly identifying relevant dyads manifests it- self in the selection of relevant dyads: rather than researchers making take-it-or-leave-it decisions, covariates are used to estimate the latent variable relevance. An application of the model to the trade conflict debate shows that probability of conflict, the quantity of interest for the traditional binary choice model based on all dyads, is non-monotonic against trade generated by the split population model. This finding provides one expla- nation for why trade is found to either increase or decrease the probability of conflict in existing research as monotonicity by chance is imposed on an underlying non-monotonic relationship.},

  Abstract                 = {With the rapid growth of the Web, users get easily lost in the rich hyper structure. Providing relevant information to the users to cater to their needs is the primary goal of website owners. Therefore, finding the content of the Web and retrieving the users??? interests and needs from their behavior have become increasingly important.Web mining is used to categorize users and pages by analyzing the users??? behavior, the content of the pages, and the order of the URLs that tend to be accessed in order. Web structure mining plays an important role in this approach. Two page ranking algorithms, HITS and PageRank, are commonly used in web structure mining. Both algorithms treat all links equally when distributing rank scores. Several algorithms have been developed to improve the performance of these methods. The Weighted PageRank algorithm (WPR), an extension to the standard PageRank algorithm, is introduced in this paper. WPR takes into account the importance of both the inlinks and the outlinks of the pages and distributes rank scores based on the popularity of the pages. The results of our simulation studies show that WPR performs better than the conventional PageRank algorithm in terms of returning larger number of relevant pages to a given query.},

Best linear estimates and Bayes estimates are derived, evaluated and compared. A characterization of the Bayes estimates is presented. This characterization has an intuitive interpretation and also provides a way to compute the Bayes estimates with a number of operations of the order of T3 where T is the fixed time span. An approximation to the Bayes estimates is proposed which reduces the total number of operations to the order of T. The results are applied to the case where the Bayesian model fails to be satisfied using an empirical Bayes approach.},

  Abstract                 = {The sharing of different stages of manufacturing processes between countries is of major and growing importance. However, due to previous deficiencies in the Standard International Trade Classification (SITC) Revision 1 system it was not possible to differentiate between two key elements of this process - that involving international trade in components and parts as opposed to the exchange of fully fabricated manufactured goods. Such a distinction was needed in order to empirically estimate the size of global production sharing. Changes in the SITC classification system (Revision 2) now allow one to approximate how much production sharing occurs within the key machinery and transportation equipment (SITC 7) group which includes approximately 50 percent of world trade in all manufactures. In 1995, OECD exports of parts and components in this group totalled \$440 billion which was about 30 percent of all shipments (components plus assembled goods) of machinery and transportation equipment. The data also show that developing countries produced and exported an additional \$100 billion of these products - which indicates global exports were in excess of one-half trillion dollars. However, the extent of product sharing is clearly larger than these figures indicate since the SITC Revision 2 system does not allow one to distinguish between components and parts in chemicals or other manufactured goods. Finally, the data also shows that over the last decade trade in machinery and transport equipment components has grown at a considerably faster pace than that for final stage products in this group. A different form of production sharing involves the use of special tariff provisions for the re-import of domestically produced components that have been assembled abroad. A second data source on this activity indicates that trade in these goods totals about \$100 billion annually with most of the activity involving the European Union and the United States. However, there again are important reasons for believing that the available data understate the importance of this exchange. Even so, these supplemental statistics illustrate the overall importance of this activity to some developing countries as over 40 percent of the total manufactures exports of Mexico, Jamaica, Haiti, Dominican Republic and El Salvador involve assembly operations using components manufactured abroad. Just how big is global production sharing? The figures analyzed in this report suggest it involves more than \$800 billion in manufactures trade annually, or at least 30 percent of the total world trade in these products. Another important finding is that trade in components and parts has been growing at a considerably faster pace than that for other (finished) products - a point that clearly documents the growing interdependence of countries in international trade and production operations.},

  Abstract                 = {The Transboundary Freshwater Dispute Database provides a framework for quantitative, global-scale explorations of the relationship between freshwater resources and international cooperation and conflict. Projects were designed to test common theories linking freshwater resources to cooperation and conflict, in particular within the context of geography and environmental security. The projects, which follow in sequence, consider three main hypotheses on the likelihood and intensity of water resource disputes. To test these hypotheses, a unique set of tools was created that links water-specific event data with a geographic information system (GIS) that meshes biophysical, political, and socioeconomic data sets at the river basin and other scales. There are three linked data sets: (1) an event data set documenting historical water relations, including a methodology for identifying and classifying events by their intensity of cooperation/conflict; (2) a GIS data set of countries and international basins, both current and historical; and (3) a spatial data set of biophysical, socioeconomic, and political variables, linked to the GIS. This paper describes the hypotheses, the above tools created to test them, and a methodological framework for utilizing the linked event and GIS data sets, providing three projects as examples: (1) indicators of international basins at risk of political tensions, (2) relationships between internal and international hydropolitics in three geographic regions, and (3) hydroclimatological variables and international water relations.},

  Abstract                 = {In this paper we seek to identify historical indicators of international freshwater conflict and cooperation and to create a framework to identify and evaluate international river basins at potential risk for future conflict. We derived biophysical, socioeconomic, and geopolitical variables at multiple spatial and temporal scales from GIS datasets of international basins and associated countries, and we tested these variables against a database of historical incidents of international water related cooperation and conflict from 1948 to 1999. International relations over freshwater resources were overwhelmingly cooperative and covered a wide range of issues, including water quantity, water quality, joint management, and hydropower. Conflictive relations tended to center on quantity and infrastructure. No single indicator ? including climate, water stress, government type, and dependence on water for agriculture or energy ? explained conflict/cooperation over water. Even indicators showing a significant correlation with water conflict, such as high population density, low per capita GDP, and overall unfriendly international relations, explained only a small percentage of data variability. The most promising sets of indicators for water conflict were those associated with rapid or extreme physical or institutional change within a basin (e.g., large dams or internationalization of a basin) and the key role of institutional mechanisms, such as freshwater treaties, in mitigating such conflict.},

  Abstract                 = {Despite warnings of conflict over shared water resources, states are reaching hundreds of treaties over their international rivers. We have extensive knowledge about the negotiations of individual treaties, but there is a paucity of systematic analysis of the forces influencing statesâ decisions to reach treaties. In addition, the few quantitative studies examining the presence of agreements fail to consider the different forces influencing the rise of bilateral versus multilateral agreements. Correcting this omission is important because scholars have discovered that states frequently sign bilateral agreements over rivers shared by more than two states. This fragmented cooperation over multilateral rivers contradicts the integrated river basin management approach long advocated by environmentalist, engineers, and water experts. This paper seeks to fill this vacuum by distinguishing between the formation of bilateral treaties on bilateral and multilateral basins, and comparing these bilateral forms of cooperation to the rise of multilateral treaties on multilateral basins. Through quantitative analysis, we argue that the type of agreement is a byproduct of state interests, transaction costs, and balance of power. By understanding these forces, we are better able to advise policymakers on how to overcome problems that stem from fragmented cooperation on multilateral river basins.},

  Abstract                 = {An approach to the analysis of data that contains (multiple) structural changes in a linear regression setup is presented. Various strategies which have been suggested in the literature for testing against structural changes as well as a dynamic programming algorithm for the dating of the breakpoints are implemented in the R statistical software package. Using historical data on Nile river discharges, road casualties in Great Britain and oil prices in Germany, it is shown that statistically detected changes in the mean of a time series as well as in the coefficients of a linear regression coincide with identifiable historical, political or economic events which might have caused these breaks. },

It introduces a unified approach for implementing these tests and presents how these ideas have been realized in an R package called strucchange. Enhancing the standard significance test approach the package contains methods to fit, plot and test empirical fluctuation processes (like CUSUM, MOSUM and estimates-based processes) and to compute, plot and test sequences of F statistics with the supF , aveF and expF test. Thus, it makes powerful tools available to display information about structural changes in regression relationships and to assess their significance. Furthermore, it is described how incoming data can be monitored.},

  Abstract                 = { We consider generalized production functions, introduced in Zellner and Revankar (1969), for output y=g(f) where g is a monotonic function and f is a homogeneous production function. For various choices of the scale elasticity or returns to scale as a function of output, differential equations are solved to determine the associated forms of the monotonic transformation, g(f). Then by choice of the form of f, the elasticity of substitution, constant or variable, is determined. In this way, we have produced and generalized a number of homothetic production functions, some already in the literature. Also, we have derived and studied their associated cost functions to determine how their shapes are affected by various choices of the scale elasticity and substitution elasticity functions. In general, we require that the returns to scale function be a monotonically decreasing function of output and that associated average cost functions be U- or L-shaped with a unique minimum. We also represent production functions in polar coordinates and show how this representation simplifies study of production functions' properties. Using data for the US transportation equipment industry, maximum likelihood and Bayesian methods are employed to estimate many different generalized production functions and their associated average cost functions. In accord with results in the literature, it is found that the scale elasticities decline with output and that average cost curves are U- or L-shaped with unique minima.

Depending on a single free parameter "{\bf preferential exponent}", this model interpolates between networks with a scale-free and an exponential degree distribution. The degree distribution in the present networks can be roughly classified into four patterns, all of which are observed in empirical data. And this model exhibits small-world effect, which means the corresponding networks are of very short average distance and highly large clustering coefficient. More interesting, we find a peak distribution of act-size from empirical data which has not been emphasized before of some collaboration networks. Our model can produce the peak act-size distribution naturally that agrees with the empirical data well.},

This article provides the first systematic test of such hypotheses at the microlevel and proposes a new account of authoritarianismÃ¢â¬â¢s durability by examining the crucial case of preÃ¢â¬âWorld War I Prussia. The article analyzes the results of a roll-call vote on a watershed piece of legislation that was defeated on the eve of World War IÃ¢â¬âlegislation that would have democratized suffrage rules in GermanyÃ¢â¬â¢s largest state. When examined systematically, this historically and theoretically important vote reveals two surprising lessons: first, landholding inequality undercuts the prospects of democratization even holding income inequality constant. Second, the nature of elite competition and electoral considerations, shaped by the institutional configuration of nondemocratic regimes, can also thwart democratization, even when socioeconomic conditions may appear to make a society ripe for regime change.},

This article reviews fours recent books that bring democracy's first wave "back in" to mainstream political science. By launching an important two-way interchange between earlier and subsequent waves of democratization, the books address three core questions: what prompts democratic openings; who are the most important actors in the push for democratization; and once undertaken, how is democracy secured. The four works offer different and at times competing answers to these questions, but all suggest that democracy's first wave was neither exceptional nor inevitable. Instead, it was marked by its own share of concessions and uncertainties, indicating the enduring relevance of Europe's democratization for contemporary cases.},

We find that major escalations in violence, such as the outbreak of the Intifada in 2000, lead to significant declines in asset prices in both Israel and the PA. Conversely, major peace initiatives, such as the Oslo accords in 1993 and the Road Map plan in 2003, lead to substantial increases in asset prices on both sides of the conflict. An additional novel finding is that asset markets respond positively to the success of politicians who favour a negotiated settlement to the conflict.},

  Abstract                 = {Students of comparative politics have long faced a vexing dilemma: how can social scientists draw broad, applicable principles of political order from specific historical examples? In Analytic Narratives, five senior scholars offer a new and ambitious methodological response to this important question. By employing rational-choice and game theory, the authors propose a way of extracting empirically testable, general hypotheses from particular cases. The result is both a methodological manifesto and an applied handbook that political scientists, economic historians, sociologists, and students of political economy will find essential. In their jointly written introduction, the authors frame their approach to the origins and evolution of political institutions. The individual essays that follow demonstrate the concept of the analytic narrative--a rational-choice approach to explain political outcomes--in case studies. Avner Greif traces the institutional foundations of commercial expansion in twelfth-century Genoa. Jean-Laurent Rosenthal analyzes how divergent fiscal policies affected absolutist European governments, while Margaret Levi examines the transformation of nineteenth-century conscription laws in France, the United States, and Prussia. Robert Bates explores the emergence of a regulatory organization in the international coffee market. Finally, Barry Weingast studies the institutional foundations of democracy in the antebellum United States and its breakdown in the Civil War. In the process, these studies highlight the economic role of political organizations, the rise and deterioration of political communities, and the role of coercion, especially warfare, in political life. The results are both empirically relevant and theoretically sophisticated. Analytic Narrativesis an innovative and provocative work that bridges the gap between the game-theoretic and empirically driven approaches in political economy. Political historians will find the use of rational-choice models novel; theorists will discover arguments more robust and nuanced than those derived from abstract models. The book improves on earlier studies by advocating--and applying--a cross-disciplinary approach to explain strategic decision making in history.},

  Abstract                 = {Why do states delegate certain tasks and responsibilities to international organizations rather than acting unilaterally or cooperating directly? Furthermore, to what extent do states continue to control IOs once authority has been delegated? Examining a variety of different institutions including the World Trade Organization, the United Nations and the European Commission, this book explores the different methods that states employ to ensure their interests are being served, and identifies the problems involved with monitoring and managing IOs. The contributors suggest that it is not inherently more difficult to design effective delegation mechanisms at international level than at domestic level and, drawing on principal-agent theory, help explain the variations that exist in the extent to which states are willing to delegate to IOs. They argue that IOs are neither all evil nor all virtuous, but are better understood as bureaucracies that can be controlled to varying degrees by their political masters.},
